    "body": "Consider the case f the client is attempting 0-RTT and sends the sequence:\r\n\r\n CI (1), Data(2), Data(3)  // packet numbers in parens\r\n\r\nNow, what happens if CI(1) is lost? The server cannot ACK packets 2, 3 because (a) it's forbidden and (b) it can't validate their integrity. So, it seems like what happens is just that eventually the client times out and retransmits CI, which means that the performance here is limited by the client's RTO, as opposed to if (say) the server's first flight was lost, when the QUIC ACKs can force faster retransmission. \r\n\r\nWhat I've been considering for DTLS is to have the receiver send an empty ACK (i.e,, one that acknowledges no packets), but that's not possible because of the QUIC ACK structure which requires you to ACK at least one packet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That causes the recipient to think that there was a connection\r\nmigration.  They will attempt to validate that address and this will fail.  The\r\nconnection is then closed.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to cause a migration back to the original, legitimate address.  For\r\nthis to work, you need two things:\r\n\r\n1. when a migration happens, abandon any validation on the old address on the\r\n   expectation that it will fail\r\n\r\n2. when a migration happens, make sure that you try to trigger packets from the\r\n   old address first\r\n\r\nFor the second point, I decided to mandate address validation, rather than an\r\nordinary PING.  The reason being that you have to retransmit the packet on that\r\npath and I doubt that implementations will want to have two sets of special\r\nmachinery for transmitting - and retransmitting - frames on a specific path.\r\nMaybe this is too much of a constraint on implementations, so I'd like to hear\r\nfrom people about whether they would prefer a more generic requirement (send\r\nany packet that demands acknowledgment would work, it doesn't even have to be\r\nthe same packet every time, though the usual situation will be that the packet\r\nwill be lost, so you probably don't want to send anything important)."

If we're talking about having load-balancer routing information baked into the Connection ID, we might need different connection IDs in each direction.\r\n\r\nThis would be relatively easy, since we're already talking about putting the Connection ID into the transport parameters -- each party just declares what Connection ID it wants the other party to use when sending packets to it, and the client's initial Connection ID is just a throw-away.  (Which might coincidentally be the same as one or both of the Connection IDs they agree to use.)  If you don't want/need a Connection ID included in your direction, simply don't provide a value for this setting.  At the same time, you'd want to make the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame symmetric rather than server-only.\r\n\r\nDual NATs would also imply that PING frames need to be sent in both directions for keep-alive purposes, which affects the guidance being added to HTTP in #744."

It would be good to be clear.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that the phrases like \"don't ack acks\" contribute to the confusion. Is it true that every packet except VN and Stateless-Retry needs to eventually be acknowledged? If so - that might be a useful clarifier.\r\n"

And packet numbers start somewhere between 1 and 2^31-1, meaning that it would be very unlikely to have a packet number that was actually small enough to fix in 1 or 2 bytes.

Is there value in having a short-circuit by which the sender of *_CLOSE can be sure it was received and go away early?\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution is to suggest responding to a *_CLOSE with a matching *_CLOSE, but that just moves the timeout to the other side.  Given that servers are likely to have a persistent connection management layer, that might be acceptable, but isn't so perfect for peer-to-peer applications."

The text doesn't give a lot of guidance on exactly how its determined (other than its size), but presumably it uses the algorithm from 5.8.. except 5.8 clearly doesn't exactly apply because the packet number defined by 5.8 is \"used as part of a cryptographic nonce for packet encryption. \" which largest acked is not.\r\n\r\nIn any event, assuming a similar algorithm we would decode by \" finding the packet number value that is closest to the next expected packet.\".. which in the case of largest ack might be \"largest previously received largest ack + 1\".\r\n\r\nSo far, that's editorial. But, as is the case with packet envelope numbers, its certainly possible to mis-decode the number.. especially when using small encodings and reorderings occur. (and this is especially true with acknowledgment information which is actually retransmitted, unlike the packet envelope numbers themselves).\r\n\r\nIf you mis-interpret an envelope packet number its no big deal - the crypto will fail and you'll drop the packet. But if you mis-interpret a largest acked field then you mark as acked the wrong data. Perhaps data that never arrived and will now never be re transmitted. And you don't have a reliable protocol anymore. :(\r\n\r\noops?"

This means something different, because previously, maxData = 10 indicated that you could only send offset till 9, however with the change, sending maxOffset = 10 means that you can send offset until 10, i.e. 11 bytes. We could alternatively change the language of maxOffset to be MUST be LESS than instead of MUST NOT EXCEED to match maximumData.\r\n\r\n* [design]  Makes FIN bit to be flow controllable. This would reduce one edge case where a packet scheduler does not have to do a special check for whether it only needs to send a FIN when it checks for flow control. This has the advantage of being able to define flow control on a stream in terms of offsets rather than max data."

    "body": "Providing the right sort of keep-alive mechanisms is hard.  TCP failed at this.\r\n\r\nQUIC is currently following in august footsteps.  The PING frame description has this text:\r\n\r\n> The PING frame SHOULD be used to keep a connection alive when a stream is open. \r\n\r\nThis is bad advice: HTTP will have a stream open always.\r\n\r\nWhat this wants to say is that a connection should be kept alive based on some application-driven signal that the connection is needed.  In HTTP, this might be reduced to if you have open requests or unfulfilled server push promises.  Other protocols have different keep-alive semantics.\r\n\r\nI propose that we do this:\r\n\r\n1. Change the description of the PING frame to say that if the application wishes to keep the connection live, then a PING frame can be sent periodically (along multiple path if maintaining multiple paths is desired).  This ensures that middleboxes don't drop state while the connection is still actively in use.  We might also say that experience with middleboxes suggests that a number between 15 and 30 seconds ensures that the greatest number of middleboxes will retain state (we can cite REQ-5 of RFC 4787 here and note that the internet sometimes doesn't pay attention to RFCs).\r\n\r\n2. Add to that description a requirement on application protocols.  If the protocol requires keep-alive at any time, it should specify the conditions under which a keep-alive is required *and the peer that is expected to maintain that keep-alive*.  Experience with SIP has shown that the server often knows more about the keep-alive timers, so negotiating the time can be more effective than having the client drive things.\r\n\r\n3. Change the HTTP draft to include specific advice on when to maintain the connection and say that the client should drive this."

The initial value (in the client's transport parameters) determines how much space the server has to send.\r\n\r\nIs this a problem?  should we exempt stream 0 (maybe just until the handshake completes)? or should we just advise against setting the value too low?\r\n\r\nNote that the value is immutable, if a client wants a low value for general use, that might be a problem for the handshake.  I'm inclined to say that stream 0 can exceed the limit up until the point that the handshake completes, after which the limit strictly applies.  Then, if it has exceeded the limit, the server can't send anything until the client gives it more budget."

    "body": "The transport parameter extension sent in the Client Hello includes the following:\r\n\r\n>      select (Handshake.msg_type) {\r\n>         case client_hello:\r\n>            QuicVersion negotiated_version;\r\n>            QuicVersion initial_version;\r\n>            ...\r\n\r\nThis is annoying, since the \"negotiated version\" will not be known until negotiation is complete. As the extension is sent in the first flight with the Client Hello, this means that the value of this Client Hello will change between the first Client Initial packet that triggered a version negotiation, and the repeated Client Initial packet that is sent with the new version number. The text in section 7.1 says:\r\n\r\n> Though the contents of a packet might not change in response to version negotiation, a client MUST increase the packet number it uses on every packet it sends. \r\n\r\nIf we keep the \"negotiated version\" in the transport parameter extension, the content of the packet will always change, so this sentence is misleading.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to only include the \"initial version\" in the transport parameter extension. The server can detect shenanigans if the initial version belong to its supported version list, yet is different from the version in the QUIC header. The client can detect shenanigans if the server supported list includes its own initial proposal.\r\n\r\nThere is an argument that the QUIC header might be forged. In that case, it seems better to include the negotiated version in the server parameters, before the list of supported versions, and trust the client to detect any disparity.\r\n"

    "body": "@kazuho pointed out that because there is no ordering between streams, you can have the need to trigger a server push on multiple streams.  If two concurrent requests identify the same subresource, then you end up having to push that subresource twice.  That's inefficient.\r\n\r\nThis is less of a problem in h2 where the server could push for the first response and avoid pushing on the second.  Strict ordering means that it knows that the client has at least seen the PUSH_PROMISE for the first response.  Of course, it's not a perfect design: routing of the responses at the client might mean that the they might be consumed by different entities, leading to the possibility that the second doesn't get a chance to see the push."

    "body": "As requested, I split this out of the unidirectional PR (#643).\r\n\r\nThere is a change here, that needs to be highlighted.  @kazuho points out that without inter-stream ordering guarantees, requests might be triggered on multiple streams.  The server then has an awkward choice: either push multiple times, or risk the client triggering requests when streams arrive out of order.  This contains a fix for that bug.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to allow the same push ID to be used in multiple PUSH_PROMISE frames.  Then, fulfillment happens at most once.\r\n\r\nI think that this is a neat fix, but it creates two more problems:\r\n\r\n1. How does a client know when the server will stop referencing a push ID in PUSH_PROMISE?  With reordering, the pushed response might arrive and be consumed before a PUSH_PROMISE that references it.  I think that it might be possible to add a counter to the push stream header that says how many times the server promised this response.  The problem with that is that if a stream that carries the PUSH_PROMISE is reset, then that counter will be too high.  I've decided to just explain the issue and add some weasel wording rather than provide a direct fix.\r\n\r\n2. What if the server provides different headers for the same Push ID?  I've chosen to fix this by simply forbidding variations in the content of the header block.  I considered only allowing the headers to appear once, but then you have to deal with that stream being reset.  Repetition should be rare enough, and header compression might be able to help with the extra bytes.\r\n\r\nI think that those problems are both less serious than the bug this fixes.  Besides, the first is really only an generalized form of a problem we have already: the stream carrying a PUSH_PROMISE can be reset.  What currently happens is that the server more or less has to send a push stream anyway, even though it can't know whether the client got the PUSH_PROMISE.  With this, a server can use CANCEL_REQUEST.\r\n\r\nCloses #702, #281."

However quic does not reset sequence number and the 0-rtt data is sent on different streams from stream 0, so can we get rid of endofearly data?\r\n\r\nthis does have the disadvantage that the TLS stack will have to omit slightly different records in QUIC than in TLS, but I believe there need to be special cases anyway in the 0rtt stream for quic, for example content type of app data is not allowed on stream id 0."

    "body": "I am afraid that the specification of packet number decoding in the transport spec is a bit ambiguous.\r\nThe transport spec says:\r\n\r\n> The sender MUST use a packet number size able to represent more than twice as large a range than \r\n> the difference between the largest acknowledged packet and packet number being sent. A peer \r\n> receiving the packet will then correctly decode the packet number, unless the packet is delayed in\r\n> transit such that it arrives after many higher-numbered packets have been received. An endpoint\r\n> SHOULD use a large enough packet number encoding to allow the packet number to be recovered\r\n> even if the packet arrives after packets that are sent afterwards.\r\n>\r\n> As a result, the size of the packet number encoding is at least one more than the base 2 logarithm of \r\n> the number of contiguous unacknowledged packet numbers, including the new packet.\r\n>\r\n> For example, if an endpoint has received an acknowledgment for packet 0x6afa2f, sending a packet \r\n> with a number of 0x6b4264 requires a 16-bit or larger packet number encoding; whereas a 32-bit\r\n> packet number is needed to send a packet with a number of 0x6bc107.\r\n\r\nSo, let's suppose a node that is processing a packet. The packet header says that the packet number is encoded on 2 bytes, and the value is PN=0x8000. The highest received number is R=0x10000. Should the receiver expand PN to PN64=0x180000, or to PN64=0x8000?"

Two bits of that byte describe the directionality of the stream:\r\n\r\n- Unidirectional (no response expected)\r\n- Initial bidirectional (one response expected)\r\n- Initial multi-response (one or more responses expected; needs a better name)\r\n- Response\r\n\r\nIf the type is Response, there's an Associated Stream ID field, length given by two more bits following the same pattern as the SS bits in the STREAM frame ID.\r\n\r\n# Personal Opinion\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, these stream types seem to cover the abstractions I can envision for most applications.  You can unilaterally send something (unidirectional), do request/response (bidirectional), or pub/sub (single subscription stream, series of update streams).\r\n\r\nI don't care for the fact that I still need the stream type header in HTTP after putting this in the transport.  That will be ameliorated if we go back to one stream per request, since all unidirectional streams will be push streams.  (As a side-note, I considered using the multiple-response option in the HTTP mapping, but then I need a stream header again to indicate which is the response and which the pushes.)\r\n\r\nI particularly don't like that you now have to look at the frame type header to find out whether a field exists which tells you the length of something else in the header.  I'd like to simplify that.  I went with this model over a CREATE_STREAM frame because of @mikkelfj's use-case of very small messages -- this adds only one byte to the first frame on a stream in one direction and 2-5 bytes to the first frame of response streams.  A separate frame type would be somewhat larger, but could be cleaner in that respect."

    "body": "Currently, if the server is in position where it has to send stateless rejects, the client has to wait two round trips before it can send any data: one to statelessly get a proof of ability to receive, and one to do the TLS handshake (now with the state).\r\n\r\nWe can do better than that.  Instead of sending only a cookie, the server can also send a certificate and a session ticket, neither of which would require storing any state.  The way I envision this is something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Client sends the ClientHello\r\n1. Server sends ServerHello, Certificate, CertificateVerify, Finished, NST and close_verify.\r\n1. Client sends ClientHello with the ticket it just received, plus any 0-RTT-eligible data it wants.\r\n1. The rest of the handshake proceeds as usual.\r\n\r\nIn order to not get stuck in an infinite loop, you'd have to opt into that scheme using an extension, and on the second attempt you opt out of it.\r\n\r\ncc @martinthomson @seanturner @ekr @ianswett "

    "body": "## Transport Changes\r\n\r\nStreams are unidirectional.  Each has three states: idle, open, and closed.  I separated the transitions for sending and receiving because that turned out to be easier to explain.  The reordering thing makes them different in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nThat's all.  The changes in transport are relatively small and they simplify streams a lot.  That it also makes the transport more generic is a nice bonus.\r\n\r\n## HTTP Changes\r\n\r\nThis is where the bulk of the changes are.\r\n\r\n### Stream Correlation\r\n\r\nPreviously request and response were implicitly correlated, as was the data correlated with the request or response headers.  With this change, that correlation each stream has a header that explicitly correlates these.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 types of stream: connection control, request, response, data, and push.  The first two have a simple header that has a type.  The next two reference another stream in their header, which ties request to response and data to request or response.  Push streams each reference a PUSH_PROMISE using a newly minted push ID (I decided that was cleaner than what I proposed at the interim).\r\n\r\nI chose backward references rather than forward references for two reasons.  First, request and response correlation can't use forward references because that would mean the client would be exerting (uncoordinated) control over server streams.  Second, that gives the server the most flexibility in terms of how it answers requests (see #281).  The cost of using backward references is that endpoints have to check that the backward references aren't bad, either referencing the wrong type of stream, or with multiple references to the same stream.\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence of a message body is signaled after the initial header block using a HAS_BODY frame.  This empty frame indicates that another stream will include the body of the message - or a promise for a body.  I would like to eliminate this stream split.  See #245 and #557 for more details on that, though we need to fix #176 first, which brings us back to QPACK/QCRAM again.\r\n\r\n### Prioritization\r\n\r\nThis changes prioritization so that it identifies requests.  I only made the minimal changes here, which means that #441 doesn't get fixed at the same time, I've left that for later (see below).\r\n\r\n### Cancelling Pushes\r\n\r\nBecause server push doesn't create streams with PUSH_PROMISE, I had to create a way to cancel them between the time that the PUSH_PROMISE is sent and when the push stream is created.  That's called RST_PUSH.\r\n\r\nUpdate: the latest version changes RST_PUSH to CANCEL_REQUEST which allows a client to cancel both requests and server pushes.\r\n\r\n## Things That Need Improvement\r\n\r\nI haven't based this on #171.  I think that functionality is good, but the last time I looked at the PR I didn't like some of the changes Mike made there.  (That's a taste thing.)  This really assumes that we accept something very much like #171.\r\n\r\nThis really needs QPACK/QCRAM.  Right now, it is impossible to cancel some types of request using RST_STREAM because not all messages will have a body (#176 again).  On balance, given that bodies are what you really want to kill, it's not disastrous, but it's a problem nonetheless.  I think that we all agree that this is something that we need to fix, but we haven't reached the point where we agree on the details of the fix.\r\n\r\n## Things That Want Improvement\r\n\r\nThis also really wants headers and data on the same stream .  It doesn't exactly need that, but merging the streams would make things a lot easy, both conceptually and structurally.\r\n\r\nI chose the simplest possible encoding for all of the fields that I touched.  That means that stream IDs are all 32 bits in size and the HAS_BODY frame takes an entire 9 octets.  For things that are that common, there are many ways in which byte efficiency could be improved.\r\n\r\nThe push ID changes suggest a fix for #441.  Use of an as-yet-not-created ID as a node in the priority tree would allow for prioritization to use \"empty\" nodes.  Needs more thought.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\nCloses #515, #240, #281, #175.\r\n\r\n(MikeBishop:  Edited to remove occurrences of \"fix <issue num>\" that were saying this PR doesn't fix that issue.  GitHub was getting confused.)"

The CCID field can be ommitted for certain packet types such as client initial and stateless retry, but it might not be worth the complexity - and then CCID can reflect the Connection ID.\r\n\r\nThe extra CCID should be removed for all 1RTT protected communication. Path migration should also provide a similar linkage from old to new, but it must be in encrypted form.\r\n\r\nSome concerns are already being addressed by reflecting the packet number and / or the CCID in some flows, but it is does not cover all cases in a unified form."

The current transmission and recovery drafts do not appear to guide the behavior in these different schenarios, notably if, how and when to retransmit connection close.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is a potentially unnecessary risk of hung connections that wait for long idle timeouts on packet loss. This can badly influence latency sensitive services.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to send multiple packets a short time apart when possible and practical. The second close packet could be prepared and thus most connection state can be torn down immediately.\r\n\r\nThe GO_AWAY frame can be use when a shutdown is controlled, but it does not handle any error codes  and does not handle when there really is an unrecoverable error."

Let the implementation do what it wants with Stream IDs – as long as it does not go over the limit, all should be well.\r\n \r\nThis phrase is a holdover from the previous version; this requirement seems to be unnecessary since issue #435 has been resolved.\"\r\n\r\nI think this is right. Now that we have also replaced concurrent streams, this seems quite unnecessary. This will clean up some more text, but I wanted to air this issue here before turning it into a PR."

    "body": "Current packet layout requires the handshake (which is conveyed in a Cleartext packet) and 0-RTT data to be sent as separate packets. In other words, you need to send at least two packets to establish a connection and send a request (e.g. HTTP request, DNS query).\r\n\r\nTo me this seems like a regression when compared to TFO+TLS 1.3, in which you can convey SYN, TLS handshake and 0-RTT data in a single packet.\r\n\r\nI'd argue that this might have real-world impact. Having the need to send two packets (instead of one) is not only costly but also has a higher chance of suffering from packet loss (especially in a lossy network), since the request cannot be processed on the server unless both of the two packets reach the server.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think that we should find a way to send both the handshake and 0-RTT data in a single packet.\r\n\r\nThere could be several ways to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nOne way that might be worth considering would be to do the following.\r\n* unify Cleartext type and 0-RTT encrypted type into one type\r\n* at the beginning of the payload of the unified type include the amount of cleartext data. Cleartext data of the specified amount should immediately follow that. Rest of the payload would be 0-RTT data.\r\n\r\nSince we would only send data of stream 0 in cleartext and we need to give precedence to the stream, storing cleartext before 0-RTT data makes sense."

    "body": "How to ignore early packets without getting in conflict with requirement to drop connection on invalid ACKS:\r\n\r\nDuring handshake a lot of packets may be silently ignored - either because they do not match the current state and could be from an adversary but could also be spurious retransmissions no longer relevant, or because of races where future protected packets races in front of a handshake and we dont' want to reserve a lot of, or any, state to packets we cannot verify immediately.\r\n\r\nKeeping state of the dropped packets might be counter-productive - notably an adversary might shadow out valid packets by simply having a cleartext packer ignored. On the other hand dropped packets might be perfectly valid such as 1RTT protected, we just don't know it yet, and don't want to allocate a lot of state to find out later.\r\n\r\nI suggest that ACK ranges received for untracked packets are ignored (not the entire ACK frame or packet). This means RTT estimation will remain unaffected and the connection will be vulnerable to attempts to suppress connection establishment.\r\n\r\nA related issue is how to count MAX_DATA in this scenario, but I haven't thought much about this.\r\n\r\nThis very lengthy discussion on pull request is about when a connection SHOULD be upset with receiving unexpected ACKS, but does not really deal with the above issue: https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/565\r\n\r\n"

X-Forwarded-For is generally useful and sometimes necessary in load balancer contexts.\r\n\r\nQUIC could be terminated at an edge server that has access to certificates not available to backend servers. In this case a new QUIC connection may be created from edge server to backend. if the application protocol is not HTTP and the backend wants to filter against blacklists or whitelists, or log traffic, it must pass this information to the edge server. The connection could also be generic port forwarding like `ssh -L 8080:localhost:9090 user@example.com`.\r\n\r\nCould this forwarding information meaningfully belong to the transport layer, for example in extended transport parameters? And for non-terminating middle boxes, could these amend the initial client packet with forwarding headers?\r\n\r\nI realise that this is a can of worms, but at least it is better to shoot it down knowlingly rather than to regret not adding it later on."

    "body": "Several existing sub-issues around what is version-independent.  I'm proposing that the cross-version envelope of QUIC should be a separate final RFC, and therefore a separate document now.  If we landed that split, it would resolve several other questions about what, specifically, is supposed to be cross-version.\r\n\r\nI would argue that version negotiation and everything that's visible outside the encryption envelope belongs in this separate draft.  It's the piece that will ossify, and that we're willing to have ossified.  Everything that's version-dependent belongs in the specific version, which is the Transport draft.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'll note that the current split means that packet protection and framing live inside the version.  That means there's a lot that will need to be re-stated in a new version -- are we okay with that?\r\n\r\nSee PR #600."

So for IPv4 and normal IPv6 that is the limit for IP/UDP/QUIC. If one would have IPv6 Jumbograms (RFC 2675) could you actually make use of them with QUIC? \r\n\r\nSo Stream Frame has a 64 K payload limit, but one can include multiple Stream Frames, different streams or depending on answer to #610 maybe the same stream. \r\n\r\nThus the question is if the documents are either explicitly saying that the upper limit to a QUIC packet is 64K, not mention this at all, or be explicit that there are no actual upper limit. This is for cases where one have an MTU that is this large and thus not trip over the conclusion of  #383 and would not have the signaling limit the packet size as discussed in  #501 "

If I understand the first sentence with the MUST, that forces the sender to increase the packet number least significant bit with additional byte(s) to fit the outstanding part of the sequence number space so that it doesn't wrap when having outstanding packets from the senders perspective. Thus, even the very old packet case should only force the sender to increase the size of the field while it is outstanding. There shouldn't be a uncertainty for the receiver.

    "body": "Quote from draft-03 section 7.1:\r\n\r\n> When the server receives a packet from a client with the long header format, it compares the client’s version to the versions it supports.\r\nIf the version selected by the client is not acceptable to the server, the server discards the incoming packet and responds with a Version Negotiation packet (Section 5.3). This includes a list of versions that the server will accept.\r\nA server sends a Version Negotiation packet for every packet that it receives with an unacceptable version. This allows a server to process packets with unsupported versions without retaining state. Though either the initial client packet or the version negotiation packet that is sent in response could be lost, the client will send new packets until it successfully receives a response.\r\n\r\nLater text protects against false version negotiation packets, but there is no reason for a server to respond with a version negotion packet for anything other than an initial packet, which is required to min PMTU sized. Rather, the server ought to drop packets with wrong versions in this case.\r\n\r\nMentioned as a related  topic here:\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/599#issuecomment-306747908"

The CONNECTION_CLOSE (or silent close) will also be invisible to the path.\r\n\r\nThis is desirable because it allows endpoints to operate in a maximum-privacy mode. However, a non-spoofable but widely readable end to path connection-is-over (or I'm-done-with-the path) signal or series of signals would, I submit, allow many internet systems to work better. The QUIC standard should specify a means of doing this, which would be optional (SHOULD, not MAY, IMO).\r\n\r\nI think the PLUS working group is working on solutions that are relevant to this problem."

Creates a \"core\" document which describes packet headers, version negotiation, and stateless reset.  Leaves to individual versions to define additional packet types and their fields.  Transport doc does that, along with all frame definitions.\r\n\r\nI'll note that it feels a little odd to have \"core QUIC\" not be multiplexed and have no concept of a crypto handshake.  We've previously said that version defines what you expect to find on Stream 0, but by the split mentioned at the interim, the very existence of Stream 0 and its use for the handshake is itself a version-local concept."

    "body": "I and some others have been looking at how to protect the connection\r\nID from correlation between any two packets. The basic threat model\r\nhere is that it's possible to have unknown network transitions and so\r\nif you just have the client initiate non-linkage events, then you\r\nmight have unknown linkage. Thus it should be, to the extent\r\npractical, impossible to link any two packets. We can -- and I'm sure\r\nwill -- debate whether this is the right threat model, but the topic\r\nof this email is just techniques.\r\n\r\nThere are two main sources of potential inter-packet linkage:\r\n\r\n- The conn_id (which is the same)\r\n- The packet number (which is sequential)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current design, which allows you to occasionally change the\r\nconn_id and then has a random PN increment, doesn't scale well to this\r\nscenario.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of two primary overall designs here, either of which will\r\nwork but neither of which is a complete no-brainer.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Omit the connection ID and then directly encrypt the packet number\r\n   with a per-connection key. This basically forfeits the automatic\r\n   connection mobility feature that the conn_id provides, because the\r\n   server/LB needs to use the 5-tuple to recover the key.\r\n\r\n2. Have the server provide the client with a pool of connection\r\n   tokens, each of which is actually a wrapped version of the\r\n   (conn_id, PN) pair. The client uses one token per packet, and the\r\n   server/LB then unwraps the pair upon packet receipt.  In order for\r\n   this to work, the server has to periodically replenish the pool,\r\n   though it's not a disaster if the client runs out, because we can\r\n   probably invent some way to reuse a token with a PN delta, though\r\n   at some privacy cost.\r\n\r\nNeither of these designs is 100% ideal. The first isn't at all\r\nconsistent with automatic mobility or recovering from NAT rebinding,\r\nwhich was the motivation for connection ID in the first place\r\n(basically, you have no connection ID). It also may come at some\r\nadditional bandwidth cost because the PN is used to compute the\r\nper-packet nonce, but at absolute worst it's 16 extra bytes per\r\npacket.\r\n\r\nThe second doesn't require giving up mobility/rebinding resistance,\r\nbut comes at some additional costs, specifically (1) some protocol\r\ncomplexity (2) bandwidth overhead because you need to send the tokens\r\nin the reverse direction [best estimate is 16-24 overall additional\r\nbytes on the wire in both direction] (3) the LB will have to do some\r\ncrypto to recover the connection ID (most likely one AES operation).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have detailed designs for both of these, though it's possible they\r\ncan be optimized further. Happy to go into these, but I think it's\r\nmore useful to discuss this at a high level rather than going into\r\nthe detailed mechanisms at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "The transport document is not very clear on how to handle errors during handshake. TLS 1.3 section 6.2 says to abort connection and send a simple error. This can be done in client or server cleartext packets.\r\n\r\nHowever, a server, or a client, may be jammed with error messages from an adversary. For servers, this can be mitigated by veryfing the Connection Id before accepting the TLS error message. For clients this is not so simple because not all server clear text messages contain the CCID. In a traditional browser client this may not be a big deal, but for peer2peer between two servers, this could be a problem.\r\n\r\nA solution could be have all server cleartext packets contain CCID in addition to SSID, similar to how Stateless Retry packets are protected, except that Stateless Retry does not also have a SSID.\r\n\r\nThe draft does not mention explicitly that cleartext packets with CONNECTION_CLOSE or GO_AWAY should be dropped, but if they are not, the same issue may happen during handshake. It would be helpful with some very explicit text about how to ignore packets and close connections when unexpected payload appears."

    "body": "In draft-ietf-quic-recovery-03 there appear to me to be an overloading of the use of the \"is_retransmittable\" flag. It appears to be used both for the purpose to indicate if there is a frame that can and need be retransmitted and if that frame should be counted as lost and impact congestion control. I think these two purposes should be separated and clarified as being two different ones. The reason is that if we create extensions that will not require retransmission of frames but needs to be included in the congestion control response a significant rewrite would be needed. I also think it would clarify things for some of the control frames also if they should be included or not, even if not regularly retransmitted.\r\n"

    "body": "In draft-ietf-quic-recovery-03, section 3.3:\r\n\r\n    The default initial RTT of 100ms was chosen because it is slightly\r\n    higher than both the median and mean min_rtt typically observed on\r\n    the public internet.\r\n\r\nI think there is points of having a fairly aggressive default RTT as it will benefit all that has a short RTT. However, it appears as this will be done at the cost of the connections that have a longer RTT, especially where the RTT is larger than 200 ms, where there will be RTO before the first response has happened. This appears to have implications.\r\n\r\nOne appears that this connection will never enter slow start? This as the first transmissions will be considered lost and one will be in recovery.  \r\n\r\nIf that is the case, should there be some additions to the slow start so that it can be used in the case described above. I was thinking that even if an RTO has fired, in cases one gets acknowledgement of those packets, without loss indication, then one could still continue with slow start, but now with an more correct RTT sample. \r\n\r\nIs this a relevant observation, or have I misunderstood anything?

If the RTT sample is very short, like a local LAN delays on the order of 1-2 ms then, the reordering events may actually be longer than the regular fraction of the RTT. \r\n\r\nThus my question on the design is if it needs any consideration for this case.  \r\n\r\nI also asking if anyone has any measurement data that provides information on how big reordering in time that occurs in these environments.

Considering that this is an packet sent when no state may exist about MTU, this needs to be limited to keep into safe levels. The general recommendation in later section is to limit full packet to below 1280 bytes. That is 1232 bytes for QUIC headers, and there are 16 bytes before this list. Thus, there is a maximum of 304 versions that fits. Not an immediate problem, but some hint to that there are a limit to N, might be valuable. "

An endpoint receiving a FIN flag causes the stream state to become “half-closed (remote)” once all preceding data has arrived\"\r\n\r\nthis seems to suggest that a sender will transition to half closed immediately after sending a FIN. Is that intentional? \r\n\r\nIt seems that it would be better for the sender to transition to FIN only after getting the ACK otherwise you'd get into a case where:\r\n\r\nSender sends FIN -> transitions to half closed local\r\nReceiver races with a RST -> sender has sent the FIN, so doesn't send a RST stream is response\r\nSender transitions to closed\r\nFIN gets lost\r\n\r\nHowever now that the sender is in closed it might still have to retransmit the FIN. Making the sender wait until all bytes until FIN are ACKed to transition to half closed local seems better, that way if the FIN (or any pending bytes before FIN) is not ACKed, the sender could just go into half closed remote like normal when it gets the RST.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of closed state being a terminal state where no additional work is needed from the sender.\r\n"

Those currently have two properties that we could hook into if we wanted to fix those properties across all QUIC versions: the packet type octet, and the size.  Either or both of those could be used as a way to filter non-QUIC noise from QUIC so that servers don't generate Version Negotiation unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nI don't think that doing this represents a particularly big commitment, but we should be careful.  The minimum size seems like it might be a constant across versions.  The packet type might be a little rough, particularly in light of techniques like that suggested in #311."

    "body": "Many large DNS server deployments rely on IP Anycast for directing UDP requests to the \"closest\" server. As we consider QUIC for DNS, it would be nice to support the same kind of deployment. However, DNS over QUIC requires server-side state. The instantaneous nature of IP routing could cause anycast packets to be delivered to the \"wrong\" server - a server instance that does not hold the state for the connection.\r\n\r\nThis could be solved if after the initial exchange the server indicated an alternative  non-anycast IP address, and maybe an alternative port number. The client could then switch to using that address, assuring then that the QUIC connection would remain stable even if IP routing did change.\r\n\r\nThere is are obvious security issues, but they can be mitigated. The server indication would need be protected against spoofing, which probably means that it would have to come as a 1-RTT packet. A malicious server could redirect client traffic towards an unsuspecting party, in some kind of DOS attack. This can be mitigated if the client sends a verification packet to the new address, and only starts using the new address for \"regular\" traffic if the verification packet is acknowledged. "

    "body": "You might need more than 1 client initial packet (perhaps an over enthusiasm for tls client hello extensions?)..\r\n\r\nThe text says \r\n\r\n> The payload of a Client Initial packet consists of a STREAM frame (or frames) for stream 0 containing a cryptographic handshake message, plus any PADDING frames necessary to ensure that the packet is at least the minimum size (see Section 9). This stream frame always starts at an offset of 0 (see Section 7.4).\r\n\r\nwhich raises a few of questions..\r\n\r\n1] the phrase \"required to be at least the minimum size\" sounds like a tautology.   Perhaps \"minimum MTU size\" would be better\r\n\r\n2] should the extra packets (those not containing offset 0) be required to be padded too? At least for reasons of reflection attacks it doesn't seem so. The https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/First-Implementation-Draft speaks of the first client packet being 1280 which made me wonder about this.. but perhaps it really just meant initial client packet rather than the first initial client packet :)\r\n\r\n3] the language of \"this stream frame always starts at an offset of 0\" is funny as it speaks of a singular \"this\" after acknowledging the packet may have multiple frames and then there is the case of multiple packets. Perhaps the clause can just be removed as all streams semantically start at offset 0 and the various out of order reassembly rules don't seem different for this packet.\r\n\r\n"

(e.g. 0x88) but the type field is defined as 7 bits and the long header packet type table lists values without the high bit (e.g. 0x08). I think we're better off without the type octet concept.\r\n\r\nAlso, public reset is defined in the table as having value 9, but in 5.6 as having a type octet of 0x88 which is already used by keyphase 1 protected packets. I think 9/0x89 is the intention. I would open a separate issue, but the merge conflict is inevitable :)\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "The \"skip a packet number\" thing as a defense against ack spoofing  is kinda hacky and seems like it is going to make life difficult for us if we want to do other stuff with packet numbers. As a concrete example, if we want to use server-issued PN tokens, then the server doesn't know what you're going to skip as a client. In addition, it's a different mode the sender has to be in.\r\n\r\nI suggest a simpler design: every ACK frame contains a 32-bit field containing the XOR of the final 4 bytes of each packet being ACKed. In the current design, these are pseudorandom as long as the content (or basically anything at all about the packetization) is at all unpredictable, because it's either ciphertext or the authentication tag. If we want, we can always add an \"entropy\" frame that randomizes the packet; it can be relatively short (one byte) because the combinatorics add up very quickly."

That's already the case, and isn't part of this issue.  #424 updates the HTTP draft to highlight this, increasing the odds that implementations will test and support that case.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track that it might actually be *desirable* from a privacy standpoint for servers to pick arbitrary port numbers and perhaps even rotate them periodically (though that requires coordination with their Alt-Svc advertisements and lifetimes, which could be challenging) in order to make it more difficult for a network observer to classify traffic (and therefore more difficult to ossify).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as we're wrestling with in each of these privacy/manageability debates, removing easy network visibility into the likely protocol by using arbitrary port numbers means that middleboxes will probably resort to other means of attempting to identify protocols and potentially doing it badly, which could result in even worse ossification.  (E.g. indexing into the TLS ClientHello to find the ALPN list, then panicking on a different handshake protocol.)"

Require the client to send an initial packet after version negotiation on the basis that version negotiation is a complete do-over.  \r\n\r\n2. Maybe also after a stateless reject, which would mean that all packets containing the ClientHello would use that \"initial\" type.  That would mean that only the initial type would have packet size restrictions,\r\nwhich is nice.\r\n\r\nThose alternatives give the server more options for changing connection ID as well, but it also removes the ability for a server-side load balancer to easily distinguish between connection IDs that the client proposes and those that the server has provided.  Not sure which way that goes, I've opted to keep the signal in place until we've had some more discussion.\r\n\r\nCloses #482, #442."

    "body": "Should we prohibit the transport from resetting streams?\r\n\r\n---\r\n@ekr asked which code a server might use to cancel streams that exceed a revised limit after 0-RTT in #479.\r\n\r\nMy initial response was CANCELLED, which I'm adding in #467.  However on reflection I think that might be a category error.  The application protocol should be the one to cancel things and we should use the HTTP-defined HTTP_REQUEST_CANCELLED instead.\r\n\r\nThe reason being twofold:\r\n\r\n* On general principles, the transport shouldn't be cancelling streams without first consulting the application layer; what if the transport cancelled stream 3 (or maybe stream 1)?  To the transport that's not special\r\n\r\n* Signaling the ability to retry is easier at the application layer.  At the transport layer the only way to distinguish between retryable and not is to ask whether any bytes were passed to the application layer.  At the application layer, even if bytes were delivered, the application might still be able to cancel without side effects.\r\n\r\nErrors at the transport layer should probably be fatal to the connection as a whole.  If you look at the error codes, there are few that aren't as a result of some sort of fatal error.\r\n\r\nThat suggests a split.  Errors in TLS or the transport go in CONNECTION_CLOSE.  Errors in the application layer go in RST_STREAM.  The nice partitioning that @MikeBishop did can be thrown out and we can fold transport and TLS into the same space (or split that, I care not)."

One of the biggest challenges with the ghash implementation is in dealing with architectures that don't have native 128 integers.\r\n\r\nFNV-1a requires multiplication of 128-bit integers.  Without native support for that operation, it's a lot more code to write and more corner cases to test.  \r\n\r\nGiven what we are using FNV-1a for, the 64-bit variant would be perfectly adequate and also considerably easier to implement.

If that ever happens, it will be easy enough to move this\r\nnew text at the same time as the packet protection.\r\n\r\nTwo choices that I made here:\r\n\r\n1. all packets are protected, including Public Reset - this means that the\r\npacket construction code can have very simple logic for determining whether to\r\nadd an integrity check, namely is there an AEAD?; the cost being that public\r\nreset is a little bigger\r\n\r\n2. the integrity check mechanism can change in a new version - this avoids\r\nexpanding the list of things that we promise that won't change between\r\nversions; the cost being one extra trivial check on receiving an unprotected\r\npacket\r\n\r\nCloses #167."

Worse, if they are aware of extensions, they might reduce the size and then encounter a server that enforces the limit.  That server will discard the packet.  That makes enforcement risky.\r\n\r\nThis change places the limit on the payload.  It mandates 1232/1252 for v6/v4.\r\n\r\nThis is the uncomplicated version.  The complicated version that I didn't write up allows a client that knows more about overheads to reduce the payload size as long as they keep above some floor value (e.g., 1180).  We might consider doing that later if we want to allow QUIC to operate on paths with a much tighter MTU overhead.  Evidence suggests that we don't need this though (open an issue if you disagree).\r\n\r\nCloses #267"

    "body": "A client may operate on equal footing with a server, i.e. it is not always a HTTP browser client, but currently a client cannot send a PUBLIC_RESET:\r\n\r\n> A Public Reset packet is only sent by servers and is used to abruptly terminate communications. Public Reset is provided as an option of last resort for a server that does not have access to the state of a connection.\r\n\r\nThe problem is also that the purpose of PUBLIC_RESET is vague. The problem here is primarily that an endpoint might loose state during a crash and cannot tell peer to terminate the connection. The related use case for informing middle boxes is a separate topic.\r\n\r\nUse case: Datacenters might have private networking, but not across datacenters. QUIC could be used to form a peer-to-peer server network. There might be edge routers in each datacenter (e.g. into a Kubernetes network), or not, but either way end-points may have high volume bidirectional traffic that needs to stop. The situation can also happen within datacenters with private networks with co-location where QUIC protects against other customers on the network.\r\n\r\nEdge routers may have to also tear down the connection across datacenters (border gateway routing) which is then the separate middlebox issue.\r\n\r\nLost-state teardown need not involve any public activity and could avoid an obvious attack vector by using a non-public reset mechanism, but middlebox signalling need this. For the endpoint tear down, it could be replacing PUBLIC_RESET with a hint on lost connection which triggers surviving endpoint to perform a low volume liveness check, e.g. PING/ack at most every x ms.\r\n\r\nFurther consideration is that post-crash a server might have to load state from persistent storage in order to perform a reset proof that is not predictable. If this can be avoided via hint/live-ness verification, persistent state reset might be avoidable.\r\n\r\nalso discussed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/462#issuecomment-297383356"

There are a few little wrinkles that I think we might want to discuss a little.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is a one-time password. That means that the combination of key and connection ID can't ever be repeated for a given server instance.  Our 64-bit connection ID space isn't really enough to provide this.  How a server moves to a new static key during operation will be challenging; it probably needs to partition the connection ID space.\r\n\r\nSecond, transport parameters are encrypted.  #20 made a point of having the verifier in the clear so that intermediaries could validate the Public Reset.  I don't want to create a second TLS extension, but I guess that is the best option we have available to us if this is what is required.  I don't think we should move transport parameters into the clear either.\r\n\r\nCloses #215, #20."

The same problem existed in HTTP/2, but it was less of a problem there because of the strict ordering provided by TCP.\r\n\r\nThis refactors the state machine to recognize that RST_STREAM is really unidirectional.  Both sides need to send it or flow control gets screwy.\r\n\r\nSo people can understand, here's the old state machine picture:\r\n```\r\n                            +--------+\r\n                            |        |\r\n                            |  idle  |\r\n                            |        |\r\n                            +--------+\r\n                                 |\r\n                                 | send data/\r\n                                 | recv data/\r\n                                 | recv higher stream\r\n                                 |\r\n                                 v\r\n                            +--------+\r\n                recv FIN    |        |    send FIN\r\n                  ,---------|  open  |-----------.\r\n                 /          |        |            \\\r\n                v           +--------+             v\r\n         +----------+            |             +----------+\r\n         |   half   |            |             |   half   |\r\n         |  closed  |            | send RST/   |  closed  |\r\n         | (remote) |            | recv RST    |  (local) |\r\n         +----------+            |             +----------+\r\n             |                   |                    |\r\n             | send FIN/         |          recv FIN/ |\r\n             | send RST/         v          send RST/ |\r\n             | recv RST     +--------+      recv RST  |\r\n             `------------->|        |<---------------'\r\n                            | closed |\r\n                            |        |\r\n                            +--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new one is a little simpler:\r\n```\r\n                            +--------+\r\n                 recv RST   |        |    send RST\r\n              ,-------------|  idle  |---------------.\r\n             /              |        |                \\\r\n            |               +--------+                 |\r\n            |                    |                     |\r\n            |        send STREAM / recv STREAM         |\r\n            |                    |                     |\r\n            |                    v                     |\r\n            |    recv FIN/  +--------+    send FIN/    |\r\n            |    recv RST   |        |    send RST     |\r\n            |     ,---------|  open  |-----------.     |\r\n            |    /          |        |            \\    |\r\n            v   v           +--------+             v   v\r\n         +----------+                          +----------+\r\n         |   half   |                          |   half   |\r\n         |  closed  |                          |  closed  |\r\n         | (remote) |                          |  (local) |\r\n         +----------+                          +----------+\r\n             |                                        |\r\n             |   send FIN/  +--------+    recv FIN/   |\r\n              \\  send RST   |        |    recv RST   /\r\n               `----------->| closed |<-------------'\r\n                            |        |\r\n                            +--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've built this on top of #450 to make my life easier in the case that #450 is accepted (in other words, I'm betting on it being accepted).\r\n\r\nCloses #458, #179."

Or, it can be useful hollistically: by aggregating reports over a large set you can determine whether a change to flow control tuning was successful.\r\n\r\nA sender of BLOCKED is currently obligated to retransmit lost BLOCKED frames.  That achieves the latter goal reasonably well, but it does little for the former because the state of the connection when BLOCKED was generated is unlikely to be the same when it is eventually retransmitted.  Even on the first transmission, the receiver of a BLOCKED frame still has to do quite a lot to work out what the state of the sender might have been.\r\n\r\nBLOCKED would be more useful if it reported the limit that caused it to be generated.  That would also solve #451."

Client (or server) opens a large number of streams by sending stream data frames with new stream number and minimal content.\r\n\r\n2. Stream choke attack. Client sends request on a stream, then use stream level flow control to choke the transmission by the server. Apply to many parallel streams for bonus effect.\r\n\r\n3. Silly stream number attack. Client opens stream 2*N+1 for some outlandish version of N. Might play havoc with server management of incoming streams.\r\n\r\n4. Stream drop by drop attack. Client sends data on a stream extremely slowly, maybe 1 byte at a time. Server spin its wheels waiting for data.\r\n\r\nI don't think that these are controversial.  Most are already well-known, we just need text for them."

    "body": "According to life of a stream, a stream can transition from \"half closed local\" to \"closed\" by sending a \"RST\" or by receiving \"FIN\" or \"RST\" from peer. However, sending a \"RST\" may race ahead of any in-flight packets send to the peer. In fact this is likely because the stream will transmit according to a fair schedule while RST will likely be prioritised. The RST will tear down state on both ends preventing the peer from receiving and the local endpont from retransmitting (depending on implementation).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there is also a user aspect. QUIC does not define an API, but what does it mean to close a stream? Do you close the write stream or do you close both read and write stream? This can encoded as either sending \"FIN\" or \"FIN+RST\" but has the race condition mentioned. When cleaning up after a stream initiated locally, it appears you need to always eventually send a RST even if the peer has no interest in writing. Application protocol could agree to not require a RST, but that seems a bit roundabout.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is saner to handle read and write streams entirely separately.\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/175\r\n\r\nThe issue may also be related to:\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/61"

Suppose now that an application sends the STREAM-DATA opening stream 5 in one packet number X, and then the opening of stream 7 in the next packet, number X+1. This is a fairly natural thing to do, for example, for QUIC over DNS, where each transaction opens its own stream. \r\n\r\nSuppose now that packet number X is lost. Packet X+1 will be processed. The receiver will see for the first time a reference to stream 7, without having seen stream 5. In a strict reading of the spec, since streams MUST be created in sequential order, the receiver should signal an error, since streams have been created out of order. But that's fiendish. Or maybe it should queue the stream 7 packet until stream 5 has been open, but that would cause head of queue blocking. Or maybe it should not care about the MUST, and just open stream 7.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, if the receiver is willing to accept stream ID opened out of order, we can have different problems. How much out of order is too much? You may want to say \"1\", but consider that a client could easily pack a dozen DNS requests and as many stream opening in a single packet. If that packet is lost, there is a gap of a dozen stream ID.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the right solution should be. "

    "body": "In anticipation of partially reliable streams I considered how it might be done today with minimal impact.\r\n\r\nThe application can ask the QUIC API to only transmit or retransmit within a specific range limit or within a specific timeframe. If this is not to violate the current protocol, the QUIC engine must still transmit data but it can then choose to send just zeroes in order to free up internal or application controlled buffers. This is a waste of good bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe QUIC engine could support a stream frame with just zeroes, using a dedicated frame type, or just a flag in a the stream header if possible. When this is set, the frame data will be absent. At the receiving end, the engine can either just fill in zeroes, or inform the application of a zero block at a given range.\r\n\r\nWith a compressed zero frame, it is then possible to handle partially unreliable streams at the API level without involving the core protocol which need not care.\r\n\r\nA zero frame can also be useful if transmitting a memory mapped file that contains large amount of zeroes - although of course one would normally apply compression.\r\n\r\nA downside of zero frames is that the receiving end cannot tell if the zero block was lost data or just valid zero data. It may derive that from the application context, or perhaps there should be a distrinction between compresed zeroes and actual gap frames.\r\n\r\nAn upside is that the QUIC protocol need not deal with length markers within streams to identify what is a message boundary so only complete messages are dropped or retransmitted.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to sparse files and TRIM sectors in SSD devices.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many other, and possibly better, ways to deal with partially reliable streams, so this is just one idea I wanted to share.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: another downside is that the receiving end may be blocking for older data just to retrieve a zero frame. However, this can also be handled at the API level, allowing the receiver to advance the stream even if data is missing - zero frames are not needed for this, except the retransmission overhead. So zero frames still provide a consistent way to treat absent data without very close end-point coordination, which may also be useful when forwarding streams to new connections or when writing to a file.\r\n"

The vendor concern is that adding support for special handling of UDP packets on port 443 would have to be absolutely guaranteed to be QUIC. At least that's what I've been told.\r\n\r\nThe other option would be to add an identifier to every QUIC packet, such that they can uniquely identify it as such.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "[I am raising this for @csperkins; text below is from him.]\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the first octet of the new QUIC header is either:\r\n```\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |1|   Type (7)  |  Long header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |0|C|K| Type (5)|  Short header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\nGiven the assigned types, this gives number values for the first octet in the ranges 0-3, 32-35, 64-67, 96-99, or 128-136.\r\n\r\nRFC 7983 talks about how to demultiplex protocols running on a single UDP port, based on the values of the first octet. The important part is the new text table in Section 7, which demultiplexes based on the value of the first octet of the packet as follows:\r\n```\r\n                   +----------------+\r\n                   |        [0..3] -+--> forward to STUN\r\n                   |                |\r\n                   |      [16..19] -+--> forward to ZRTP\r\n                   |                |\r\n       packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS\r\n                   |                |\r\n                   |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel\r\n                   |                |\r\n                   |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP\r\n                   +----------------+\r\n```\r\nThe QUIC headers don’t fit cleanly into this. The result is that it’s not possible to run demultiplex QUIC and WebRTC running on the same UDP port, since WebRTC uses STUN, DTLS, TURN and RTP/RTCP. Demultiplexing these is probably desirable, since it would let you switch from web traffic to interactive WebRTC or very low latency streaming without de-doing the NAT bindings on a port.\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix to allow the protocols to be demultiplexed is to set the top two bits of the first octet of a QUIC packet to 1 and reduce the size of the type fields:\r\n```\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |1|1|1|Type (5) |  Long header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n |1|1|0|C|K|Type3|  Short header packet\r\n +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\nThere are probably other options that keep a larger type field, if we accept a less obvious bit packing, although even these likely lose one bit from the type field.\r\n"

    "body": "We've already had a lot of discussions about the concurrent streams limit, which all brought us back to the problem that at every given moment both peers have to agree about the number of open streams, which seems to require a non-trivial amount of bookkeeping (of ACKs received for all STREAM frames sent on a given stream).\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a different solution, which solves this problem, and has a couple of nice additional properties as well:\r\n\r\nA receiver advertises the maximum Stream ID it is willing to accept. The sender is allowed to open all streams that have IDs not larger than this number. The receiver can advertise a higher maximum Stream ID whenever it likes to, by sending a STREAM_LIMIT_UPDATE frame. STREAM_LIMIT_UPDATE is a retransmittable frame that contains a single value, the maximum Stream ID.\r\nNote that conceptually, this is similar to advertising a flow control offset (and the rules for STREAM_LIMIT_UPDATEs would be similar to those for WINDOW_UPDATEs).\r\n\r\nAn implementation is free to choose any algorithm to determine which maximum Stream ID it advertises. The number of open streams may be used, but I can think of a couple of other ways to limit the state a peer can create. It would even be possible to advertise different limits depending on the server load."

    "body": "There is a common problem throughout the draft whereby the document talks about state transitions triggered by sending a packet.  This is necessary when the state causes resources to be committed, but when resources are freed it is invariably wrong.\r\n\r\nThus, we have two classes situations for a sender that need to be clearly distinguished:\r\n\r\n1. Actions that reserve resources take effect as soon as the first packet is sent.  This includes:\r\n   * sending the first STREAM frame on a stream (which consumes a concurrent stream),\r\n   * the first transmission of and STREAM data (which moves the flow control offset),\r\n   * sending a packet that adds to the header table (which reduces the available space there), \r\n   * etc...\r\n\r\n2. Actions that release resources take effect when they are acknowledged.  This includes:\r\n   * sending a STREAM frame with the FIN flag set (which can release a stream),\r\n   * sending a RST_STREAM frame (which can release a stream),\r\n   * deleting a header table entry (which eventually frees space),\r\n   * etc...\r\n\r\nWhen describing these, we need to be careful to be very precise about these things.  In particular, STREAM frames with a FIN flag can both consume resource and release them.  The consumption happens immediately, but the release depends on acknowledgment."

    "body": "TLS has an extension on the NewSessionTicket that limits the amount of early data.  This limits the number of plaintext octets (not including padding) that can be send in early data.  This allows a server to constrain how much clients send in 0-RTT.\r\n\r\nWe could reuse and repurpose that extension for QUIC, but we would have to do so explicitly.  Currently, we do not.  Or, we could define a new transport parameter that explicitly limits the size of incoming 0-RTT data.\r\n\r\nWe could define this count in a number of ways:\r\n1. Count the number of octets in each packet before packet protection is applied.\r\n2. As 1, except after packet protection is applied.\r\n3. Count everything except padding.\r\n4. Count only STREAM payloads (i.e., use the same accounting as flow control).\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for option 4 for reasons what will become obvious in a parallel discussion (see #390)."

That's great, and much easier to implement.\r\n\r\nHowever, when removing STOP_WAITING, @ianswett wanted to have a way to solicit an ACK so that a receiver could stop sending acknowledgments for some packets.  He suggested using PING, which is great.  I have another suggestion that I think is superior: WINDOW_UPDATE.  Like PING, WINDOW_UPDATE causes an ACK to be generated, albeit with less urgency and a receiver is highly like to need to send one occasionally.  I think that PING is still viable, but WINDOW_UPDATE is likely to happen naturally anyway."

I also removed the flow control exemption in line with other decisions we have made not to exempt stream 1 (it counts toward the concurrent stream limit, for example).  That was harder, but all it takes is realizing that we have default values for flow control that can be used prior to handshake completion.  Those defaults are so abundantly generous that only the most perverse certificate (or PQ key exchange) will get close to overflowing.\r\n\r\nCloses #248."

For IPv6, that message has a large chunk of the original packet, proving that a path element sent it. For IPv4, there is very little entropy there (just your src port).\r\n\r\nCan this be as trusted as PUBLIC_RESET by Clients? For IPv4 the answer is likely to be \"no\". For ipv6, I am not that sure. But there are real implications for clients that cannot just fall back to tcp.\r\n\r\nIf you ignore ICMP and keep retrying the dead server, you are very likely missing an opportunity to switch the server (switch to another IP offered by DNS).\r\n\r\nIf you do not ignore ICMP (especially ICMPv4) and try reopening the connection (using a different server IP), you are allowing using your client in a highly amplified reflection DDOS attack against the sever. The attacker just needs to send you a slow stream of forged ICMP to get you to keep re-opening/re-negotiating connections and retrying expensive requests."

It really only updates the frames defined in RFC7540; the ALTSVC frame defined in RFC7838 isn't updated.\r\n\r\nIt would be a simple update, but the question is where it belongs.  Should we:\r\n\r\n- Add text in this document to include that frame, because it is \"existing\"?\r\n- Write a new (very short) document updating RFC7838 with HTTP/QUIC support, following the recommendations in #363?\r\n- Kick it back to the httpbis working group to write exactly the same very short document?\r\n\r\nNote that the latter two options probably differ by nothing but the filename of the I-D in question -- the same people will probably end up writing it."

    "body": "ILubashev's suggestion on #171 alludes to this; separating it out as a new issue.\r\n\r\nConnection-level flow control is currently defined as a cumulative sum of all bytes _received_ on all streams.  However, if you receive STREAM frames out of order, you can know that more data is in flight, even if you haven't received it.  Currently, that data implicitly counts against the receiver's stream window (since it's a max offset), but not against the connection window.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the receiver of a DISINTEREST frame to silently stop retransmission if the STREAM w/ FIN had already been acknowledged (without generating a RST_STREAM) since the flow control states on both sides would be consistent.  However, it would also require more logic on STREAM receipt, since it's no longer just a running counter of the size of all received STREAM frames."

    "body": "@martinduke suggested that we might remove CONNECTION_CLOSE in favour of using a Public Reset packet.  That would require that the error code be made public knowledge.\r\n\r\nI can see a few advantages for a middlebox, primary of these being a clear signal that a connection is done (though that would not be something that could be strongly authenticated).  It would also simplify state on servers that decide to terminate a connection: they only have to keep whatever information they need to generate a Public Reset, which is a single piece of global state. \r\n\r\nThe downside is the insights that the error code give into the otherwise confidential operations of the protocol (we'd likely want to tighten the level of detail in error codes).  Also, it means that a server that wants to permit retries would have to send two packets: a GOAWAY packet in addition to the Public Reset."

    "body": "My sense is that we'd like the server to chose the \"real\" connection ID to be used for a connection. Among other things, this enables servers to embed routing/load balancing information into connection IDs.\r\n\r\nI have heard two options for what the client should do before it has a server-chosen connection ID.\r\n\r\n1) Send a random connection ID\r\n2) Send a connection ID of 0\r\n\r\nIf we go with approach 1, then we need some mechanism that load balancers can use to detect if a packet's connection ID is server-chosen or not. It seems likely that all packets encrypted with 1-RTT keys could use server generated connection IDs. But other packets it's not so clear. Consider the case of a non-0-RTT handshake. The initial client handshake packet would include a client-chosen connection ID. When the server replies, it could use a server-chosen connection ID. If so then when the client sends the next handshake packet it could use the server-chosen connection ID as well. But that means that we'd need a mechanism to disambiguate client handshake packets with client-chosen connection IDs from client handshake packets with server-chosen connection IDs. We could devote bits or packet types to indicate this. I suspect the same argument might hold for server handshake packets. We might not want the server to chose a connection ID until it is ready to accept the handshake.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of this approach, however, is that a QUIC server could chose to simply use the client's connection ID for the duration of the connection. This would mean that it would not need to be able to generate a new connection ID that is guaranteed to be sent by the load balancer back to itself. In cases where the vendor of the load balancer and the server are not the same, this might be valuable.\r\n\r\nIf we go with approach 2, then it's obvious that any packet with a non-zero connection ID has a server-chosen connection ID (though the server still may want to verify that it's a \"valid\" connection ID according to the algorithm it uses). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this requires QUIC servers which are behind load balancers to be able to generate connection IDs which the load balancer will route back to them. If the server and load balancers are from different vendors, this might be challenging.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "A lost handshake packet is retransmitted after 400ms (assuming that you don't have prior knowledge of the RTT, if you do then it is 2xRTT).  I realize that this is probably shorter than in TCP, but it's still a damned long time to wait.\r\n\r\nWe are far more aggressive in this in WebRTC with DTLS.  For example, NSS retransmits three times before QUIC even sends its first: at 50ms, 150ms, and 350ms.  We haven't seen much evidence that this is bring the Internet to its knees.  It's certainly good for latency to retransmit more aggressively.  Separately, we also send ICE probes much faster, without the back-off, though those are typically much smaller.\r\n\r\nThat said, if retransmitting at this pace is somehow doing damage to something, it would be good to understand why this is the case.  We're definitely interested in avoiding an inadvertent damage that we're doing and changing the above numbers could happen pretty quickly with proper justification."

    "body": "We're starting to see a few cases where ACK frames are being used to close the loop on things.  But that raises questions like \"if a peer acknowledges a packet containing a GOAWAY, does that mean I can assume that stream above the mentioned number are now closed at their end?\"\r\n\r\nI think that we need to state what the rule is, and it should be simple.  An acknowledgement for a packet implies that all QUIC-level control messages have been read and processed.\r\n\r\nThis includes PING, ACK, RST_STREAM, GOAWAY, etc...  I think that it also has to include FIN bits on STREAM frames.  That implies that the *transport* must have finished handling all the messages.\r\n\r\nThe application protocol might not have consumed the data from STREAM frames, but that is the only thing that is considered outstanding when a packet is acknowledged.  We have a special sort of acknowledgment for data: flow control credits.\r\n\r\nIf we add features that include special acknowledgement (like flow control), then those would be excluded, but that would be explicitly stated.  Otherwise, if it is in the transport and it is acknowledged, then it has been processed by the receiver."

We could avoid this by multiplying these values by a constant (she suggests 1024), which would reduce the granularity with which flow control credits could be granted, but increase the total lifetime of a long-lived connection.\r\n\r\nSo, trade-off time.  The scaling multiplier is now 1.  A larger value allows for longer-lived connections, a shorter value allows finer control over flow control.  I'd suggest that values in the order of 8 are probably easy to justify, can we go as high as 1024?\r\n\r\nWe could also choose a different value for the connection and stream flow control offsets on that basis that connections need more octets, whereas streams do not."

I would suggest that the analog of a TCP FIN is a FIN on a QUIC stream as they both gracefully half-close a single bidirectional communication channel. After a FIN, retransmission of data may still occur to deal with packet loss.\r\n\r\nA QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE, on the other hand, is an immediate termination of the connection. No more data is retransmitted. As such it is more like a TCP RST."

This is purely a safety margin feature, so mandating a value isn't justified.\r\n\r\nAn implementation could, though perhaps it is unwise, use a much smaller packet number than this.  The risk is that there is reordering greater than 2^size and the packets are delivered but cannot be recovered at the receiver.  That's terrible, it will trigger loss recovery and send bad signals.  However, the protocol doesn't actually break.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, we should make this a recommendation.  Setting a mandatory floor on the value might be reasonable, but I'd be reluctant to do that unless it was pretty low, or if the value were different for different packet number sizes (smaller margins are probably more justifiable for larger packet number encodings).\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should science this and try to measure probabilities of reordering.  Ideally reordering probability as a function of outstanding packets."

Both endpoints only need to maintain timing information for individual packets for a short period, so retransmission of old timing information isn't valuable.\r\n\r\nThus, we should recommend that endpoints do just that: maintain a short list of packets that they want to provide timing for.  They should then not worry about re-sending any timestamps from lost packets."

This implies that every packet number in the timestamp block is expressed relative to the \"Last Acked\".

    "body": "> skipping packet numbers between 1 and 255 effectively provides up to 8 bits of efficient entropy on  demand, which should be adequate protection against most opportunistic acknowledgement attacks.\r\n\r\nAside from the odd phrasing, I think that this is incorrect.  Aside from the obvious point that 1-255 is only  7.994 bits of entropy, you also have to take into account the probability that a sender chooses to skip (a probability of 2^-8 would give the answer here).  Add to that the fact that any entropy accumulates with every packet sent.  Choosing to send or withhold each packet number could add up to a bit of entropy over time, so the difficulty in guessing could be higher over time.\r\n\r\nNo matter what strategy it's always safe for an attacker to guess high, so the amount of effective entropy against an attacker is probably less than claimed.  Of course, guessing high has an effect on congestion control, because that is marked by the sender as loss.  That could be as effective in mitigating the optimistic acknowledgment attack as the gap itself.\r\n\r\nThen there is real packet loss.  If you randomly decide to skip 255 numbers, then real packet loss on the packet after the gap makes it difficult to acknowledge (you have to send two ACK frames if there is a gap >255).  Burst loss makes that even more likely.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'd recommend removing any claim about entropy.  I also recommend removing any mention of specific numbers.  Skipping more packets is fine, but it means that you run the packet number space down faster and you get less efficiency in ACK packets."

    "body": "Ostensibly, the `quic` parameter is a performance optimization for Alt-Svc.  A client can learn what QUIC version is most likely to succeed and use that version.  That increases the chances that version negotiation succeeds and thereby reduces the chance that the QUIC connection setup costs an extra round trip.\r\n\r\nHowever, alternative services is precisely the point where performance is not critical.  The client already has a perfectly functional HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 connection to the server.  This is a point where they could afford an additional round trip on connection setup.\r\n\r\n@MikeBishop suggested that if we are serious about greasing version negotiation, perhaps we could remove the `quic` parameter from the Alt-Svc header field and force clients to always pick a greased version number for their initial packet.\r\n\r\nAdvantages: grease more often and version negotiation actually gets a real workout, disadvantages: an extra round trip every time you use Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\nThis came up in #278."

    "body": "In #278, @martinthomson says that clients MAY choose a GREASE value for their initial packet to force version negotiation.  I would argue that no self-interested client will do so if the connection is latency-sensitive, since you incur an RTT, unless the spec has this at a higher level than MAY and with specific timing.\r\n\r\nHowever, for HTTP, bringing up a connection to a new Alternative is not latency-sensitive (because you still have your connection to the original host).  In the case where you're bringing up a connection to an alternative instead of to the origin, you've likely talked to the alternative before.\r\n\r\nWe could consider dropping the Alt-Svc version hint entirely, and saying that clients SHOULD open with a reserved version unless it has previously connected to the server and remembers a version list."

That smells like something from the Google QUIC implementation.  We should be more concrete about this, if that behaviour even makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf an endpoint is receiving nothing but ACKs but is sending itself, then acknowledging those ACKs is probably fine.\r\n\r\nAn endpoint with nothing to say can generate a lot of ACKs over time, but if both endpoints are being quiet other than ACKs, it's probably time to shut up entirely.  Maybe we should say that the peer SHOULD generate an ACK frame only if it has other frame types to send.\r\n\r\nLimiting the number of PING frames that a peer will respond to is a separate issue, and may motivate a limit with a number attached to it.\r\n"

    "body": "The text for packet number size calculation says:\r\n\r\n> a QUIC sender MUST NOT have more than 2^(packet_number_size - 2) in flight\r\n\r\nWhat it means to be \"in flight\" is not defined.  It seems like it might mean unacknowledged, not including packets that were marked as \"lost\" by the recovery algorithm.  The difference between the current packet number and the highest acknowledged packet number might also work.\r\n\r\nThe more that I think about this, the more that I'm convinced that this is made up of 90% fudge.  Neither of the above definitions for \"in flight\" is perfect and the constant (4) is pure fudge.\r\n\r\nWhat we might ideally want to ask before determining how big the packet number encoding needs to be is how far out of order a packet could possibly get during transit - and at what point we consider excessive reordering to be considered loss.  If we assume either definition, the current mandate assumes that we want to recover from delay of 4 times the RTT (with the first definition, add four times the reordering threshold).\r\n\r\nThat seems excessive.  Given that we should be getting at least an ACK per RTT in these cases, that much delay will likely result in retransmission several times over unless all of the ACK packets are similarly delayed.\r\n\r\nWhile we might make some recommendations, \"MUST\" doesn't seem correct.  I suspect that we need data on reordering (or packet delays) under real-world conditions before we could make a better recommendation.\r\n\r\nI think that we need to make the following changes: \r\n1. define \"in flight\" (or use a new definition based on RTT and the reordering threshold)\r\n2. make this a recommendation rather than a requirement\r\n3. update the values in the recommendation based on data\r\n4. maybe advise being conservative: spending an extra byte or two occasionally might be wise if it means avoiding packets being lost\r\n\r\nThis issue should wait for the outcome of the header discussions, it could become moot."

    "body": "In HTTP/2, streams states were modified at the point that a PUSH_PROMISE was sent, but actually using that stream could be deferred.  The \"reserved\" state didn't count toward concurrency limit, those streams would count only when packets were first sent.\r\n\r\nIf the client had a low concurrency limit, that could mean that use of promised streams had to be deferred until active streams could be closed.  QUIC maintains a similar model, but that model is incompatible with QUIC.  In HTTP/2, any promised streams can be opened without creating any ambiguity about the state of other reserved streams.  HTTP/2 also allowed endpoints to skip stream numbers.\r\n\r\nIn QUIC the lack of ordering between streams (a feature!) forces us to insist on having a strict monotonic sequence of stream numbers.  If a stream number appears to be skipped, that is only because a packet using it has not yet arrived.  This ensures much simpler accounting for streams and avoids adding latency to stream creation.\r\n\r\nThis creates a problem for promises.  Servers cannot use streams in any order, only those streams within the window of streams permitted by the client concurrency limit are free to be used.\r\n\r\nFor example, a client could have an MSPC of 2.  That allows just one server push at a time.  A server that wants to push two resources could advertise one push on streams 4+6 and the other on 8+10.  However, unlike in HTTP/2 the server cannot start the second push first.  Opening stream 8 would imply that streams 4 and 6 are also open, violating the concurrency limit.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear that this problem needs a solution, but it is a functional regression that we should at least consider and make a conscious decision to accept."

The observation there is that using stream X implicitly opens stream X-2; since all streams are opened in sequence, it must just be that the packets that mention stream X-2 got delayed or lost somehow.\r\n\r\nOnce you accept that, it's also reasonable to allow a different order of stream creation (the point at which numbers are allocated) and stream *use* (when you send packets on a stream).  This neatly addresses the issue whereby server push can promise use of streams, but not use them in the order in which they were promised.\r\n\r\nThere's a catch here, and it's not one that was introduced by this change, if a server promises more streams than the client permits in its concurrent streams limit, the server cannot use streams beyond the limit.  I'll open a bug on that.\r\n\r\nCloses #182 - that removed only a few of the application actions.  This removes all of them.\r\nCloses #174."

    "body": "Something that came up in Tokyo was the need for service providers (i.e. middleboxes) to troubleshoot performance issues in the network. Packet Number Echo (#269) could partially address this problem., particularly for RTT measurement. But it is imperfect for measuring other problems.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has spent quite a bit of time debugging TCP packet traces from service providers, there are two other things that would help greatly in answering the question \"why is my QUIC slow\", without significantly compromising privacy. To do both would take two bits in the public flags, which may be available depending on how some other issues turn out.\r\n\r\n(1) QUIC endpoints MAY set the BLOCKED bit if they include a BLOCKED frame in the packet. If you want to get fancy, you could have a different bit for \"stream blocked\" and \"connection blocked\", but flow control issues are a common cause of traffic pauses with no other discernable symptoms.\r\n(2) QUIC endpoints MUST (SHOULD?) set the RETRANS flag in any packet that contains retransmitted data. This would help operators identify that a connection is slowing down because it is responding to loss, and would allow for very reliable loss statistics for the downstream network."

As agreed at the interim, TLS will host the source address validation packets, but the transport will be responsible for constructing and validating the token.  I've expanded the detailed interface section to cover this.\r\n\r\nThere's some finessing in the text around which part adds the integrity check, with the recognition that - because the token will likely be put alongside other TLS information that needs integrity checks - TLS is probably the best place to do that.\r\n\r\nThis builds on #122 because to do otherwise would be to invite merge conflict hell.  Once that is merged, this will be much easier to review.\r\n\r\nCloses #174, #52, #118."

    "body": "PR #106 added the following requirement on servers:\r\n\r\n> Servers MUST reject the first plaintext packet received from a client if it its total size is less than 1280 octets, to mitigate amplification attacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, this runs into an issue in the case where there are IP header extensions that the client knows about but the server doesn't.  If the client is aware of the IP header extensions and constructs a packet with a smaller payload in order to comply with our recommendation to create a packet of exactly 1280 octets, the server will receive a packet that it thinks is too small.\r\n\r\nI see a few options:\r\n1. loosen the enforcement constraint on the server\r\n2. specify that the server only enforce the constraint if it sees the entire IP packet\r\n3. specify the minimum size and its enforcement in terms of payload size (we could set different values here to allow for header extensions)"

    "body": "This is an issue we briefly discussed in a coffee break in Tokyo, that nobody has written up so far.\r\n\r\nWe currently don't have a definition of the number of concurrent streams that both peers agree on at every given moment. Chrome and quic-go solve this problem by allowing a higher number of open streams (10% or 10 streams more, whichever is higher, than the advertised limit). This seems to work fine for HTTP, but will probably break down when using many short-lived streams.\r\n\r\n### Problem analysis\r\n\r\nThe main problem here is that it is very difficult for the sender to determine if the receiver considers a stream closed at any given moment. To do so, it would have to keep track of all packets containing stream data for that stream. Only when all of those packets have been ACKed (or retransmissions of those packets, if any packets were lost), it knows that the stream changed its state on the receiver's side.\r\n\r\nI think there's a more fundamental problem hidden here: Receiving a FIN should not cause a state transition in the first place. The concurrent stream limit is supposed to protect a receiver from allocating to many resources. Therefore, a stream should only be considered closed once the application finished reading from that stream (which, if it is reading the whole stream data, is only possible after receiving the FIN, but might be an arbitrary amount of time later, if the application is reading slowly).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a way for the receiver to tell the sender that it considers a stream closed. We could introduce a CLOSED_STREAM frame type for that.\r\nA peer would send a CLOSED_STREAM frame only after it closed the stream locally (i.e. only from the *half closed (locally)* state) and after it finished reading from the stream. \r\nA peer receiving a CLOSED_STREAM can immediately remove the corresponding stream from the list of open streams.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can work out the details and provide a PR for this, but I'd like to discuss the proposal here first. It might make sense to finish the changes regarding the resetting of streams (related issues: #165 and #171), since this will already significantly change the stream state diagram."

I've taken the notion of \"final offset\" and formalized it more:\r\n\r\n* Define final offset as the offset of the end of stream data\r\n* Describe how the final offset is carried in RST_STREAM and STREAM frames\r\n* Final offset can't change, describe the error to use\r\n* Data can't be sent after the final offset, describe the error to use\r\n* Update the field name in the RST_STREAM frame description\r\n* Reference the relevant text in the closed state in both of the half-closed states\r\n\r\nThe major technical difference here is that generating a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error is not mandatory - that would force endpoints to keep a 64-bit final offset for closed streams, which causes state commitment beyond their concurrency limit.\r\n\r\nThis closes #145 by superseding it."

    "body": "While HTTP/QUIC doesn't formally require a client to implement Alt-Svc, there's no discovery mechanism other than Alt-Svc provided, so you're not going to get very far without it.  That makes a full HTTP(/TLS)/TCP stack mandatory simply to open the connection in the first place.  For various reasons (e.g. an embedded device in a controlled environment), a client might want to dispense with TCP altogether when it knows that the endpoint will support QUIC.  It might also be useful in testing to be able to directly reference a QUIC endpoint.\r\n\r\nShould we mint new scheme(s) that allows direct reference to a resource served exclusively over HTTP/QUIC?\r\n\r\n(Note, in HTTP/2 the answer was \"no,\" because HTTP/2 could be negotiated using the same TCP connection.  QUIC doesn't have that luxury.)"

It's also exempt from the congestion controller and has special rules about retransmissions.  Is there a logical reason to have stream-level flow control on a stream that is a control channel?\r\n\r\nIf not, let's make it clear that the crypto stream is special.  Make it Stream 0, the stream that can't be given any stream-level flow control credit because it's a reserved value.  The change is relatively modest, and seems like a good fit to our special snowflake stream."

    "body": "The TLS draft currently states that the associated data for AEAD encryption is the empty sequence. This is a deviation from legacy QUIC, which uses the public header as associated data and thus authenticates those fields. Packet number authentication is already accomplished due to its inclusion in the IV.\r\n\r\nIn Tokyo, there was considerable interest in a couple of features that require integrity of Public Header fields:\r\n- Greasing the unused bits in the Public flags\r\n- The connection ID may be used for routing.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that firewalls might block unused public flag bits, particularly if any middlebox could potentially alter them without detection to send a signal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest that we restore use of the full publice header as associated data. I see no reason that this would impose excessive costs on the receiver.\r\n\r\nI believe @janaiyengar brought this issue up first, though I fully endorse it."

This is part of the charter text:\r\n\r\n> This mapping will accommodate the extension mechanisms defined in the HTTP/2 specification.\r\n\r\nRFC 7540 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5.5) defines three extension mechanisms, lets order these as:\r\n\r\n1. New frame types\r\n2. New error codes\r\n3. New settings\r\n\r\nI can see how 1 and 2 might work out, following Mike's example of augmenting existing definitions and allowing for things that exist in the HTTP/2 and HTTP/QUIC spaces to be managed somewhat independently. A concrete use case I have is the ALTSVC frame (especially when used on stream 0), so I'm happy to contribute towards this issue with some guidance.\r\n\r\n3 has some problems related to proposed SETTINGS changes.\r\n\r\nFinally, extensions that could change of semantics are a bit problematic (does it change the HTTP or the QUIC semantic, if that either of those is even possible). Additionally,  the negotiation of these is trickier given the additional negotation concerns of QUIC (0-RTT etc).\r\n"

    "body": "Quoting myself from the mailing list:\r\n\r\nTL;DR. Encrypt the packet number with ECB or something like it. This\r\nis probably a bad idea but I wanted to write it down.\r\n\r\nI had an idea last night about encrypting the packet number. Here's\r\na diagram of a QUIC regular packet:\r\n\r\n ```  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |   Flags (8)   |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +                     [Connection ID (64)]                      +\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                        [Version (32)]                         |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ \r\n   |                  Packet Number (8/16/32/48)                 ...\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                    {Encrypted Payload (*)}                  ...\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   ```\r\nThe insight here is that the reason that the packet number is outside\r\nof the encryption is because it is used as the nonce for the AEAD\r\nfunction. However, there are encryption algorithms (which we usually\r\navoid for various reasons) which do not need a nonce. Specifically,\r\nwhat we could do is derive two keys:\r\n\r\n  K_h: header encryption\r\n  K_p: packet encryption\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you get:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |   Flags (8)   |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +                     [Connection ID (64)]                      +\r\n   |                                                               |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n   |                        [Version (32)]                         |\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ^ \r\n   |                 {Packet Number (8/16/32/48)}                ... | encrypted with K_h\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ v\r\n   |                    {Encrypted Payload (*)}                  ... ^\r\n   |                                                                 | encrypted with K_p\r\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ v\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis of course leaves the question of which crypto mode you use to encrypt\r\nthe packet number. The natural choice is ECB, but that only works with\r\ndata values the same size as the cipher block, which for AES is much\r\nbigger than the packet number (128 bits). So, that's waste, though you\r\nmight of course add stuff to the block if we had other headers.\r\nWe could use 3DES (which has a 64-bit block) or FFX (which can be used\r\nwith any block size, but at some additional computational cost).\r\n\r\nTwo pre-emptive responses to common questions:\r\n\r\n1. Yes, ECB and FFX are not generally as good as AEAD algorithms, in\r\nparticular because they don't have integrity and they reveal patterns\r\nin the plaintext. However, this is data which would (a) otherwise be in the\r\nclear and (b) is folded into the ordinary AEAD integrity check.\r\n\r\n2. As long as we correctly generate K_h and K_p independently using\r\na KDF, then any weaknesses in K_h don't implicate K_p.\r\n\r\nAgain, this probably isn't worth doing with the current amount of\r\nstuff in the headers, but I wanted to write it down so that people would\r\nknow about it.\r\n"

    "body": "QUIC doesn't make order guarantees between streams.  The options on the table currently are:\r\n\r\n- Current (-01) draft puts a sequence number in the frames; HPACK data MUST be handled in order, and will HOL-block.  HPACK is exactly the same as HTTP/2.\r\n- Buck's proposal (draft forthcoming) puts two sequence numbers in the frames and modifies the HPACK encoder to prevent blocking references.  Partially-received HPACK frames must block until fully received.  The new encoder could also be used in HTTP/2, but would require changes to existing code.\r\n- [QPACK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bishop-quic-http-and-qpack) modifies HPACK to be order-resilient and permit partial frames to be processed, but breaks from the HPACK encoding enough that you'd have at least some separate code paths.\r\n\r\nAlso agreed to put a \"hard-hat warning\" in this section of the HTTP draft, to warn readers this is still work-in-progress."

If we don't, then 0-RTT data will be unacknowledged until\r\n  the handshake completes.  This isn't a problem if the handshake completes\r\n  without loss, but it could mean that 0-RTT stalls when a handshake packet\r\n  disappears for any reason.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume what you're talking about here is the case where the server's first flight of packets are lost, because the server can only find itself in one of two positions because the CH must fit in a single packet.\r\n\r\n- It has no ClientHello, in which case it must buffer any packets\r\n- It has a ClientHello, in which case it can can complete the handshake by sending its first flight.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that having stalling of 0-RTT in the case where parts of the server's first flight are lost is not that big a deal. If you really don't want stalling, you should retransmit faster :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Open stream 5\r\n3. Close stream 5\r\n4. Open stream 7\r\n\r\nThe network reorders packets 3 and 4. From the server's perspective, the client has violated the maximum.  In order to deal with this, the server will presumably need something more complicated than just \"if violated, kill\" -- maybe kill the connection if it *remains* violated for more than 1-2 RTT?"

On the TLS layer ALPN handshake, client advertises its versions and server picks one.  This is not guaranteed to produce the same version in absence of MITMs, since client and server might have different version preferences.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we change the TLS layer negotiation into \"QUIC client says its version, and server says its supported versions\", similar to #97 .  That way, we effectively repeat the version negotiation information used on transport layer in the handshake, allowing the peers to compare the authenticated information from the handshake with the one they used in transport, and tear down the connection in case those do not match."

    "body": "This issue directly applies to the use of Server Proposed Connection ID (issue #119) / Stateless Rejects (issue #60).\r\n\r\n\"Origin servers\" are often complex multi-server data centers with load balancers. Some \"origin servers\" are actually globally distributed load balancing and routing systems, possibly with multiple levels of load balancing (for example global and local).  Since packets may show up at any load balancer node (both for global and local load balancers), it is very difficult (if not prohibitive) for these load balancers to keep track of the load balancing decision for each active connection and share that state among all nodes.\r\n\r\nTo enable stateless load balancing, load balancers need every packet to include routing information for its connection. Server Proposed Connection ID (#119) with Stateless Rejects (#60) are the methods of choice, as they allow the \"origin server system\" to encode some information into the ConnectionID -- a part of the public header present in every packet.  However, depending on the complexity of the encoded routing information, 64 bits may not be enough to ensure a sufficient amount of entropy in the ConnectionID.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to allow Server Proposed Connection ID to include additional information to be present in every packet. That additional information can take a form of an optional longer Connection ID (and therefore be immutable) or be a new mutable part of the public header."

    "body": "There are currently two problems with streams not contributing to connection-level flow control:\r\n\r\n1. There is no way to negotiate which streams don't contribute (and their number is not limited one would have to negotiate an equation). For HTTP the non-contributing stream numbers are defined in the HTTP/QUIC draft, but defining those streams statically might not be suitable for every protocol.\r\n2. Non-contributing create a DoS opportunity. Current implementations of the QUIC protocol use a MCSP of 100. That means that a client can consume at least 100 * initial flow control window of memory on the server (and possibly even more since there's no size limit of a GET request). That results to an additional memory consumption of more than 6 MB (for comparison: Chrome and quic-go set the connection-level flow control window to 1.5 MB).\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nNon-contributing are needed in the following situation: A client that is uploading data will be connection-level flow control blocked if it is sending data faster than the server is consuming it. In that situation, it makes sense to stop the client from overloading the server with more data, but at the same time allowing it to issue new requests.\r\n\r\nThe problem could be solved by defining two connection-level flow control windows: One that defines the amount of data that can be sent, and one that is defines the amount of request data and other application-layer control functions. I will refer two the two windows as \"data fc window\" and \"control fc window\".\r\n\r\nThe rules are:\r\n\r\n- When a peer opens a new stream, it defines which of the two windows the stream should be counted to (This could be done by the setting a bit in the STREAM frame public flag, but we'd have to steal it from some other field. Maybe there's a better solution?). The association of a STREAM to one of the two window cannot be changed later. Every stream has to contribute to either of the two windows.\r\n- A receiver maintains the two connection-level flow control windows and sends connection-level WINDOW_UPDATEs appropriately (there needs to be a way to distinguish between a WINDOW_UPDATE for the data and for the control window of course. Maybe use a bit of the frame type?). \r\n- In HTTP all data MUST be sent in the data fc window, and all request, PRIORITY and SETTINGs frames MUST be sent in the control fc window.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Is this general enough for all protocols? Can the messages in every protocol be mapped into the two categories \"data message\" and \"control message\"?\r\n"

    "body": "One of the major features of QUIC vs TCP is the option of seamless connection migration. One can conceive of a situation where a network middle-man (e.g. an ISP, firewall implementer, etc) might have an interest in blocking this feature, e.g. by detecting connection migrations to their network and dropping those packets. I propose that we think of a way to make a connection migration indistinguishable from a \"normal\" new connection.\r\n\r\nOne solution I can think of would be to have the client send a \"fake\" initial packet with 0-RTT encryption (which would then be discarded by the server as undecryptable). The first few packets sent on the new address would also need to have the version bit set – which the server would have to ignore.\r\n\r\nThis would also require initial packet number randomization (see #35).\r\n\r\nThis issue might conflict somewhat with #185.\r\n\r\nThanks to @lcolitti for pointing this issue out."

    "body": "I know that this might be a hard decision to make, but we don't have many settings and it seems like we might be able to avoid changing them mid-connection.\r\n\r\nGetting settings synchronization right is a pain and we really only have one that is ever likely to change and that's the header table size.  We don't allow initial flow control windows to change (no mechanism exists to allow it), so I question whether that needs changing.  If it does need to change, that would be for the same reason that the flow control window needs to change, which suggests we would need to devise a way to change those too.\r\n\r\nSETTINGS_ACK is a huge amount of machinery.  With 0-RTT, it will mean that just opening a connection will trigger a flurry of SETTINGS_ACK frames from the client just to respond to the server's connection preface (assuming that we're still keeping that, it's not clear).  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we reserved a space for application-specific traffic parameters (see #122), we could put the application-layer settings like header table size in the handshake.  That has some downsides (client values would be unencrypted and you would need to include one set of parameters per application protocol on offer), but it means that there couldn't ever be any confusion about the value of a given setting once the connection was open.\r\n\r\nThat would be a huge simplification to the HTTP mapping."

That, in turn, means that no future HPACK frame can be interpreted, ever, because you're missing part of your history.\r\n\r\nOops.\r\n\r\nMy first inclination is to change the HTTP draft to say that message control streams MUST NOT be reset.  If you don't want the message body, reset the data stream, but you MUST read the message headers.  If, for some reason, you cannot do so, then terminate the connection.\r\n\r\nAnyone see a barrier to that (other than the price of ginormous headers)?"

    "body": "QUIC borrows the HTTP/2 state machine, or tries to replicate it as much as it can.  Part of that replication is the idea that a stream is bidirectional.  The state related to outgoing data and the state related to inbound data are tied.\r\n\r\n#174 suggests a simplification that could open up a more dramatic simplification: independent state for each direction.  #171 moves in that direction also.\r\n\r\nThe state machine that results from that is dramatically simpler: idle -> open -> closed.  That is, before packets, packets and after packets.\r\n\r\nThe consequence for the HTTP mapping is largely that it needs a different method for correlating request and response.\r\n\r\n## Correlating request and response\r\n\r\nCurrently, request and response are correlated by matching the stream identifier.  However, unidirectional streams would allow for cases where streams are not created symmetrically.  For instance, server push would only require streams from the server.  Similarly, the server would not be obligated to respond to requests in the order in which they were received (if at all, since it could reset request streams).\r\n\r\nThat implies that this would add a requirement for the server to identify which request a given stream is answering.  This is an extension of the requirement in #174, which only required that the server identify a push promise (actually, it's less onerous, because you only have one request per stream).\r\n\r\nI can imagine an arrangement where a stream containing headers identifies the stream containing the request headers from the client.  Then the stream containing the body identifies the stream that contained the headers.\r\n\r\n## Saving stream identifiers\r\n\r\nThis is a minor point, though it could be relevant for very long-lived connections.\r\n\r\nQUIC currently insists on a strictly monotonically increasing stream identifier: stream N is followed by stream N+2 always, no skipping of streams is permitted.  Aside from wasting every other stream identifier, other streams are wasted by the mapping. \r\n\r\nGET requests don't include a body, but nonetheless require that the client send a HEADERS on stream N, then a FIN on stream N+2.  Including a reference to the initiating stream at the start of the body of a message would use some octets, but potentially fewer than would be used otherwise (particularly if the reference was a varlen encoding of the difference in stream numbers, which would rarely be anything other than 1).\r\n\r\nObviously, this is an optimization for the case where there are no bodies, but that is a case where the optimization is particularly valuable.  Making more requests (which more frequently have no bodies) during the early stages of a connection is critical to performance."

    "body": "QUIC borrows the concept of stream reservation from HTTP/2.  However, there is a small difference between those state machines in that a reserved stream becomes open when data is sent on it.  HTTP/2 reserved streams become half-closed in this case (basically, only the server can send on a reserved stream).\r\n\r\nThe reason we have reservation is that we use stream numbers to identify requests at the HTTP mapping.  We reserve the stream number so that we can use its number in the PUSH_PROMISE frame.  That ties the PUSH_PROMISE - which contains a request - to the stream containing the response.  We need to create streams sequentially, so reservation allows us to \"create\" the stream in the right order and still be able to reference it.\r\n\r\nIn practice, however, this is a nuisance.  Reserved streams don't count toward concurrency limits and so they represent an unbounded state exposure.  Reserved streams might be created in order, but they can be used in any order.  Of course, this is a minor annoyance at best because there is always application state, and maybe priority information for these streams.\r\n\r\nI believe that QUIC has the opportunity to address this annoyance and in the process make the state machine simpler.  If QUIC removed the concept of stream reservation and instead required that application protocols create their correlators for use with talking about future streams, that would greatly simplify things.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we could remove the promised stream identifier from PUSH_PROMISE.  Instead, the stream that carries a push promise response could start with a frame that identified the PUSH_PROMISE by stream and number: \"this stream contains the response for promised request number P on stream N\".  Or, we could mint a new PUSH_PROMISE identifier that could be carried at the start of the stream."

(Retains the existing requirement to respond with RST_STREAM with another RST_STREAM if the stream isn't already closed, which eventually leads to the same result.)\r\n- New REQUEST_RST frame allows peer to solicit a RST_STREAM; text states that this reflects an app recv_close, and that received data is being discarded\r\n\r\nThis should solve the scenarios outlined in #165; a server can ask a client to RST_STREAM its own direction after having sent an early response.  Feedback welcome, of course -- please point out anything I've missed."

    "body": "Fast troubleshooting of QoS is mandatory to maintain end users high Quality of Experience;\r\nThere are my cases of troubleshooting. A typical example starts by the signaling to the ISP that its end-users are experimenting a significant decrease of QoE when using an Internet application. Typical point of failures are line cards memory errors or overloaded routers located somewhere on the path, either in the ISP domain or outside.\r\n\r\nThe ISP NOC has to localize asap the point of failure. Currently it proceeds by dichotomy (is the point of failure inside ISP domain or outside ?) using passive monitoring of packet lost and congestion. \r\n\r\nFollowing is the description of the parameters in use:\r\n\r\n1. Packet lost downstream (vice versa for upstream): \r\n- Measure of packet lost before the point of measure needs TCP sequence number\r\n- Measure of lost after the point of measure needs TCP ACK + SACK \r\n\r\n1. Congestion: \r\n- Detects that the congestion is located either before or after the point of measure\r\n- Analysis based on TCP ACK+SACK observation\r\n\r\nQUIC packets numbering should be continuous to allow packet loss monitoring. Flows control fields (ACK, SACK) are available in QUIC but encrypted. \r\n\r\nIt should be nice to use the approach of the TCPinc WG (with an integrity check mechanism) to keep visible the fields allowing fast troubleshooting of the network layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I'm writing this issue because there was some discussion about a change I made in #145, that seemed to be controversial. I spent a lot of time thinking about this, and realized that my changes in that PR were insufficient to address the problem. I think there are multiple issues in the stream state machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Two common scenarios\r\n\r\nI will describe two scenarios where RST_STREAMs will be used regularly when using HTTP/QUIC.\r\n\r\n### Rejected PUSH\r\n\r\nThe sender (in this case a HTTP server) uses HTTP/2 Push to push a resource that the receiver isn't interested in. The receiver therefore sends a RST_STREAM with offset 0 (since it didn't send any data on that stream) to stop the sender from pushing the resource.\r\n\r\nWhen the sender receives the RST_STREAM, there are two options:\r\n\r\n- the transfer hasn't completed yet: The sender then stops sending data and sends a RST_STREAM with a byte offset equal to whatever highest data offset it sent. RST_STREAMs are transmitted reliably, so both sides will *eventually* receive the other side's RST_STREAM and make adjustments to their flow controller. There is no problem here.\r\n- the transfer has already completed (i.e. the sender already sent a STREAM frame with the FIN bit): According to the draft, STREAM frames on reset streams are not retransmitted. If the STREAM frame with the FIN gets lost, and the sender will never be able to make the necessary adjustments to its flow controller. (I'm not sure, but maybe this is what #163 is about).\r\n\r\nA fix for this problem is to **always** send a RST_STREAM as a response to a RST_STREAM, even if the stream already transitioned to the *half closed* state by sending a FIN bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### POST to a 404 URI\r\n\r\nThe second example is more involved, since it involves data flowing bidirectionaly (note that for the PUSH case, the receiver never sent any data on the stream):\r\n\r\nThe sender (in this case a HTTP client) performs a POST request to an URI that the receiver is not reading from, e.g. a non-existing site (HTTP status code 404). The receiver will first send the HTTP response header, and then the (non-empty) 404 body. It will send send a RST_STREAM with a offset equivalent to the body length, to stop the sender, to stop it from sending more data.\r\n\r\nOn the sender side, we have the same situation as in the PUSH case, but let's assume we already resolved that issue.\r\n\r\nThere are two more issues here:\r\n\r\n- We must ensure reliable delivery of the response body (the 404 page). Thus, although the stream was reset, STREAM frames need to be retransmitted.\r\n- The receiver can only send the RST_STREAM **after** composing the response body (since the final byte offset has to be included). However, it would make sense to send the RST_STREAM as soon as possible, to stop the unwanted upload.\r\n\r\nThe first issue could be fixed by requiring that the peer that is resetting a stream MUST ensure reliable delivery of stream data it sent, whereas a peer that is receiving the RST_STREAM SHOULD NOT retransmit any stream data.\r\n\r\nThe second issue could be fixed by defining a RST_STREAM frame that doesn't include a byte offset (or introducing an RST error code that indicates that the byte offset is not set). The receiver in the above example would send this RST_STREAM before sending the 404 body. Since stream data is transmitted reliably, the sender would eventually receive a highest byte offset with a STREAM frame carrying the FIN flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Open points for discussion\r\n\r\nDo the three changes capture all possible use cases of resetting streams. Or do we need\r\n* a way to reset a stream such that the peer initiating the reset doesn't ensure the reliable transmission of the data it already sent\r\n* a way to reset a stream such that the peer receiving the RST has to ensure the reliable transmission up to a certain (which?) offset\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "RST_STREAM kills a stream, but what impact does it have on connection flow control?  Or are we required to account for data in STREAM frames even if they are discarded?\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that data on reset streams is not re-sent, therefore peers get a very different view about what data has been sent.  The receiver of RST_STREAM has no way to manage connection-level flow control for the packets that it has sent.  Packets that it sends before receiving the RST_STREAM might be lost and therefore they might or might not have been counted by the other side.\r\n\r\nAt best, this results in an overly pessimistic view of the connection-level flow control window.  Though it could end up freezing the connection if there are lots of RST_STREAM use with concurrent packet loss.\r\n\r\nThe sender of RST_STREAM can signal the offset of the last octet and thereby ensure that their data is accounted for.  (Separately, we need policing for this value: if it indicates that a flow control window was exceeded, we should treat it as such, even if the frames that it mentions were never sent: opened #162.)\r\n\r\nA potential fix: require RST_STREAM in both directions.  A more drastic fix: make streams unidirectional.\r\n\r\nRelated to the issue @marten-seemann originally mentioned in #145."

That opens an attack where the attacker establishes a connection, then starts spoofing source address.  If the server starts to send to that source address without verifying that the client can receive packets, that's potentially a powerful packet amplification attack.\r\n\r\nIt's not sufficient to look for ACKs or other such things, because no client message includes proof that the client has actually received a packet from the server.  A client can just generate ACK and WINDOW_UPDATE frames as necessary, even new requests.  The only risk a client runs is that it overestimates the number of packets that the server has sent and sends too many spurious ACK frames, which the server will then recognize and react to."

A PADDING frame has no additional fields.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to discuss whether a padding frame that can be inserted anywhere, instead of only as the last frame in a packet, makes sense.\r\n\r\nI'm currently doing a [zero-copy implementation of QUIC](https://github.com/NTAP/quant) on top of [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) via a [userspace IPv4/UDP stack](https://github.com/NTAP/warpcore), which due to static DMA mappings requires an app to place stream frame data directly into packet buffers at a (fixed) offset. The QUIC stack then inserts the common header and other frames before the stream frames, and needs to pad any unused space. Currently, this isn't possible.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I'd like something similar to the [No-Operation TCP option](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#page-18).\r\n\r\n(And it's an open question whether going to great lengths to support zero-copy TX is actually all that useful, given that we're going to do crypto over the entire buffer anyway.)"

Rather than loss triggering a retransmission of the frame that was lost, loss should trigger the creation of a NEW frame with updated details.\r\n\r\nIn [this comment](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/150#discussion_r96152215) @janaiyengar observes that probably all of the control-like frames could be treated specially if they need to be retransmitted.  Changing the \"retransmission\" rule for control (i.e., non-STREAM) frames to allow for updated information to be included might not benefit many of the other frame types, though it might make sense to make the rule general to allow for some flexibility\r\n\r\nSee also #146 where there is discussion about verbatim retransmission of STREAM frames."

WINDOW_UPDATEs should be sent when the application consumed data sent by the peer, they should not be based on the highest received offset.\r\n2. I specified the error that should be sent if the peer violates the advertised flow control windows.\r\n3. I explicitly allow an optimization both Chrome and quic-go are already doing: WINDOW_UDPATEs are always sent twice. This increases the probability that the peer receives the frame and can continue sending data, even if one of the two packets is lost or delayed.\r\n4. The description of connection-level flow control was incomplete, since not all streams contribute to the connection-level flow control window. Furthermore, the receiver now has to check for connection-level flow control violations."

    "body": "The current design of the header with its multiple variable length and variable presence fields would seem to require inordinate sender and receiver code complexity. Complexity, especially in parsers (i.e., on the receiver side), is a source both of unclarity in specifications and errors in implementation. I note the following specific issues:\r\n\r\n(1) There are thirteen possible header lengths, and therefore data offsets : 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21. Each of the header fields has a variety of possible offsets. This also increases the complexity of hardware offload implementations of QUIC, but is not complex enough to prevent their implementation and deployment.\r\n\r\n(2) There are combinations of flags that seem to be nonsensical and/or contradictory (e.g., the Packet Number Length codepoint adds 1, 2, 4, or 8 to the length if the Public Reset flag is clear, but 0 to the length if the Public Reset flag is set, see ; Public Reset and Version are mutually exclusive.)\r\n\r\n(3) There appears to be no consideration given to reducing confusability with other deployed UDP protocols in the first N bytes of the header -- see #147 \r\n\r\nI would suggest reducing the number of possible header layouts to reduce complexity, based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n(1) The set of variable header lengths will, at most, save a number of bytes per packet that will often be lost in the underflow of suboptimal path MTU discovery.\r\n\r\n(2) Varlen packet numbering makes sense if the packet number always starts from zero, but random initial packet numbers have other advantages; I presume we'll adopt them at some point. Packet numbers only need to be large enough to keep wrap-arounds to be induced by reordering, so 32 bits (as in the TCP sequence number space) is more than sufficient.\r\n\r\n(3) There is value in treating a version number as a magic number to help reduce the chance of misrecognition of non-QUIC packets as initial QUIC packets at an endpoint; for this 32 bits of version are more than enough, and 24 probably suffice. (This will require a redesign of the version number space, which we might want to do in light of #147 anyway).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an initial proposal, I would propose that either both Connection ID and Version be present, or neither, and that packet number be always present and constant length. This reduces the set of necessary flags to three, leaving us with five flags for reserved/future use (four, if we go ahead and allocate multipath) and the following two header layouts:\r\n\r\nFull Header: 16 octets\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|1|R|K|M| zero  |      version/magic (24 bits)                  |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|                                                               |\r\n+-                      Connection ID                          -+\r\n|                                                               |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|                       Packet Number                           |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\n\r\nTruncated Header: 5 octets\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|0|R|K|M| zero  |                       Packet Number       . . .\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n. . . (cont'd)  |\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe header invariant then becomes \"If bit 0x80 in octet 0 is 1, then the seven remaining bits of that octet are reserved for use as flags, and octets 1-3 are a 24-bit version number. If bit 0x80 in octet 0 is 0, then no version number is present; use previous version information for this 5-tuple.\" This can be further simplified by dropping the truncated header entirely, though for very short packets the overhead might be worth saving.\r\n"

    "body": "The design of the QUIC packet header should consider the ease of creating an apparently-valid first packet via reflection against existing, widely deployed UDP protocols (DNS and NTP being the top two here). All easily reflectable packets off these services should be trivially droppable by a QUIC server. Otherwise, there exist a variety of possible DDoS attacks (of which #135 is one case).\r\n\r\nFor 1-RTT first packets, the probablity of creating a valid ClientHello would seem to be negligible, though there might be some value in reducing the processing necessary to recognize and reject reflected garbage, or to allow it to be rejected before delivery to the server process.\r\n\r\nFor 0-RTT first packets, the header layout should be defined such that a version number (or other magic pattern, though the version number space is sparse enough that it can do double duty as a magic pattern) has an offset and bit pattern that does not occur in traffic that can be generated via reflection off common UDP services."

    "body": "I added two commits regarding the closing of streams.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the draft already states that a peer that received stream data beyond the final offset (received either in STREAM frame with the FIN flag set or in a RST_STREAM frame) MUST close the connection with a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error. \r\nHowever, due to packet reordering, the packet carrying the final offset might be delayed, such that the peer first receives STREAM frames up to a certain offset, and then receives the final offset, and notices that the final offset is smaller than the offset it received before. In this case, it MUST also terminate the connection with a QUIC_STREAM_DATA_AFTER_TERMINATION error.\r\n\r\nThe second commit is concerned with what happens when a RST_STREAM is received. A common use case is the following: A client sends a POST request to a server and already begins sending data, but the Request URI doesn't accept data (e.g. there's an error 403 or 404). In those cases, the server will send a HTTP response (note that a 404 has a non-empty response body), and immediately after sending the last byte of the 404 response, it will send a RST_STREAM in order to stop the client from sending more data. In this case, QUIC needs to make sure the data sent by the server is delivered to the client (i.e. the server MUST retransmit any lost data, even after receiving the RST_STREAM response from the client), and the client MUST deliver the data received to the application, even if the packets containing the response body are delayed such that they arrive after the RST_STREAM sent by the server."

    "body": "Servers shouldn't need to send more than one version negotiation packet, they only resend so that they are stateless and to deal with packet loss on the return path.\r\n\r\nClients should ignore version negotiation packets if they already have received packets from the server.  \r\n\r\nThis requirement on the client could be used for denial of service in the case where the legitimate server needs to use version negotiation.  If an attacker can race a legitimate looking ServerHello at the client (which isn't impossible), then the client will ignore the real server's attempt at version negotiation.  This is hard for an off-path attacker due to the need to echo certain parts of the client initial packet.  (I'd say connection ID is enough, but that might run afoul of #119.)"

Furthermore, it spoofs the sender address of this packet to the address of another QUIC server (server B).\r\nThe packet sent by the client will look like this:\r\n1 byte Flags: 0x9 & Packet Number lengths bits\r\n8 byte Connection-ID\r\n4 byte Version Number\r\n1, 2, 3 or 4 byte Packet Number\r\nAEAD data\r\n\r\nServer A will discover that it doesn’t support the QUIC version that the client suggested, and reply with a Version Negotiation Packet, which will get sent to server B. The version negotiation packet will look like this:\r\n1 byte Flags: 0x9\r\n8 byte Connection-ID\r\n4 byte 1st Version Number\r\n4 byte 1st Version Number\r\n....\r\n\r\nIf server B doesn’t support the version sent as 1st Version Number by server A, it will not be able to distinguish this packet from a packet sent from a client (according to [Section 5.1.2](https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-transport.html#handling-packets-from-different-versions) it MUST NOT read anything from the packet except for the Flags byte, the Connection ID and the first Version Number). Furthermore, according to [Section 6.1](https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-transport.html#version-negotiation) the server MUST reply to server B with a Version Negotiation Packet.\r\nAssuming that server A doesn’t support the version sent as 1st Version Number by server B, A and B will continue sending each other Version Negotiation packets indefinitely. Note that the attacker only sent a single packet."

    "body": "The document currently (though I hope to remove this) makes certificate compression a requirement of the cryptographic handshake.  TLS doesn't really do compression, though it does provided cached-info ([RFC 7924](https://tools.ietf.org/html/7924)).  Is this sufficient or do we need to ask the TLS working group for a compression feature.  I'm assuming that if we did need to ask, we would also be responsible for providing a design.\r\n\r\nNote that TLS 1.3 aims to provide confidentiality for certificates and compression is generally fraught with hazards that compromise confidentiality.  It also potentially a feature that could leak information about a client's past connections to servers.  If we due pursue this, any design we create would need to carefully consider these (and likely other) risks."

This is an explicit configuration item, even though TCP flow control would naturally limit the amount of data a client can send to a server with 0-RTT.  The reason for this is that servers might have to hold some or all of the 0-RTT data.  That buffering might be part of replay mitigation, for example.  A server that supports 0-RTT can use that limit to ensure that it doesn't have to buffer more than it is willing to buffer.\r\n\r\nIn #122, I have chosen to carry over the values for initial flow control window and concurrent stream limit.  We might want to provide separate transport parameters for 0-RTT so that servers can apply lower limits."

    "body": "Is there the potential for a version downgrade if the client is given unauthenticated hints about the version(s) that the server supports?\r\n\r\nIt's true that Alt-Svc will be authenticated in MOST cases, so maybe we don't have to worry about this.  On the other hand, it creates problems for analyzing the security properties of the negotiation.  I would suggest that we should insist that the Alt-Svc advertisement be authenticated before using any hints.\r\n\r\nThat could rule out the DNS as a source of version hints."

I've opened #119 to track that.  I removed some other TODOs, for which I've opened #118 and #117 as well.\r\n\r\nI'm on the top of a large stack of changes now, and approaching saturation.

    "body": "When talking about priority in #104, the question arose.  Say you have two streams and a STREAM frame to send on each, but only enough capacity to send one (due to flow control, congestion, or whatever).  Prioritization information helps us answer this question.  But what if the message is a retransmission of a packet that was determined to be lost.\r\n\r\nI think that the right answer has to do with tracking how long since a packet was originally given to QUIC to send.  And that we don't necessarily need to concern ourselves with whether it was sent previously or not - that will shake out in time anyway.  If it was sent before, it was obviously high enough priority to be worth sending once already.\r\n\r\nThat said, the value of repairing a gap in a stream is pretty high in terms of the ration of bytes delivered to bytes transmitted, so that might have some say."

This is made easier because it only relates to packets that are exchanged before a connection is setup.  Closes #55.\r\n\r\nI've aligned the version negotiation section with the recent changes to -tls.  That includes the client including a version in all packets prior to the commencement of packet protection.\r\n\r\nI'm laying some groundwork for later changes here.

    "body": "The way HTTP/2 Priority is generally implemented is to keep a minimal amount in the TLS pipeline / TCP send buffer, retaining as much flexibility as possible to insert frames from high-priority streams ahead of those from lower-priority streams if they become available before the low-priority frames have been \"committed\".  Once data has been encrypted or sent to TCP, it must be sent even if higher-priority data has become available.\r\n\r\nIf the QUIC transport layer has no notion of priority, HTTP may have to do the same on each stream.  It might be preferable to provide the data for each stream into the transport as it becomes available, since the transport is already performing the framing functionality, but that would require the transport to take priority into account when deciding which stream's data to put on the wire next.\r\n\r\nThis need not be a wire format change (HTTP can continue to communicate priority at its layer), but should perhaps be noted as a useful property of an implementation and part of the defined interface with the application layer."

A few related changes along the way that are hopefully uncontroversial:\r\n\r\n- Added a notation conventions section, à la RFC 5201, describing the things we're adding to RFC 2360 (including the ones borrowed from 5201).\r\n- Shifted to using the term \"payload\" rather than \"headers\" and \"body,\" since those are never actually used in the descriptions of subsequent packets or frames.  (Describing frame payloads rather than repeating the Type each time simplifies the diagrams and makes them align more nicely.)\r\n- Totally removed the Diversification Nonce field, since that's optional and dependent on a removed bit (in [32e9d5](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/commit/abf5b35a047f33e75f5d31a2b65c26699532e9d5))\r\n- Removed most of the text and the diagram from the Public Reset, since that depends on specs not in evidence (QUIC-Crypto) and I didn't want to do a diagram of an obsolete packet format.  We'll augment EKR's PR with a diagram later.\r\n- Converted the figure-of-a-table of frame types to an actual table, with references to each section."

Client MAY open a new connection immediately if it discovers the server would have supported a newer version, and SHOULD use the newer version next time.\r\n- Server SHOULD pick an application protocol supported by the client's proposed version; Version Negotiation only if no overlap on the current version."

However, if the server does Version Negotiation, the client's ClientHello gets thrown away, and the client has to resend the ClientHello anyway.\r\n\r\nI'd be more inclined to say that servers select application protocols compatible with the current version if it can.  There are then two possibilities:\r\n\r\n  - Client learns that server supports a newer version in the response.  Then the client can try again (in parallel or in the future) over the newer version.  Same RTTs to reach the new version/protocol, but able to exchange some data on the initial connection 1 RTT sooner.\r\n  - Server supports no protocol compatible with the client's supported version, and triggers Version Negotiation anyway.

    "body": "#87 covers improving the current use of ALPN and the Alt-Svc v= parameter for HTTP.  However, I think this is something that QUIC needs to solve generically, so forking off a separate issue for that.\r\n\r\nHere are the paths I see that we need to support:\r\n\r\n- **Client to server, first time:** This is inherently a 1-RTT handshake *if* the client guesses the version correctly; 2 RTTs if it's wrong.  This incents clients to attempt the most widely-deployed version of QUIC rather than their highest version.  Consequently, there needs to be a way for a conservative client to discover that a server supports a more advanced version.\r\n- **Client to server, subsequent:** The cached information should contain information about the server's supported versions so the client can come back with the same version as last time. The scenarios where one side has changed need consideration, though:\r\n    - **Client upgraded:** Would require client to cache server's full set of supported versions and compare against the client's supported set at connect time, not just caching the selected version.\r\n    - **Server upgraded:** The current mechanism offers no way for a client to discover that the server would have accepted a version it didn't initially offer, whether because the server didn't previously support it or the client is being conservative.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to see these solved for QUIC independent of Alt-Svc -- there will be other users besides HTTP.\r\n\r\nI think this could be solved by requiring the server to always send its Version Negotiation list in the crypto handshake, not just if a Version Negotiation packet was actually sent.  Clients can discover when the server supports a newer version than they attempted, and either know what to offer next time or actively open a new connection with the new version in parallel."

    "body": "Because of a stated goal from some implementers to reuse HTTP/2 framing as much as possible, the draft currently augments the HTTP/2 Frame Type Registry with a \"Supported Protocol\" column, allowing a frame to be defined for HTTP/2, HTTP/QUIC, or both.  A specification is required for each supported protocol.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the current draft, all but one \"Both\" frames are *different* between HTTP/2 and HTTP/QUIC.  Small or large, nearly every frame has required some modification to work over QUIC.  If we accept #80 , *all* frames will be different between HTTP/2 and HTTP/QUIC.\r\n\r\nAt that point, is there really a point in continuing to define HTTP/QUIC in relation to HTTP/2, or should we just admit that it's a new, separate thing that's heavily inspired by HTTP/2?  Separate registry, etc., and future extensions can register themselves with both if appropriate?  Or do we keep the same registry anyway to enforce that you'll never wind up with totally unrelated frames sharing the same value across the two protocols?"

    "body": "[EXTENDED_SETTINGS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bishop-httpbis-extended-settings-01) was proposed in the HTTP WG as an extension providing an alternative to the HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame.  While feedback was that it was \"the design we should have had for HTTP/2... more general, saves space in most cases, and includes a flag to request acknowledgment\", there was also a feeling that as an extension it was overkill since most things that needed settings already used SETTINGS.  The advice was to hold it for HTTP/QUIC and make it the default SETTINGS frame there.  So here it is.\r\n\r\nNote that while it uses a slightly different ACK mechanism than HTTP/2 SETTINGS, it's subject to the same timing issues as HTTP/2 SETTINGS ACK over QUIC, namely that you can't know when the setting change has been applied on each stream.  This pull request doesn't fix that; it's tracked by #75 still."

The current HTTP/QUIC draft allows a frame to be 64KB long before decoding the HPACK.  Is this large enough?  That was the boundary we'd said it would take in HTTP/2 to require a single frame.\r\n\r\nIf not, the current draft uses the END_HEADERS bit to indicate that another HEADERS frame will follow, which is effectively the same as CONTINUATION.  The same is not currently defined for PUSH_PROMISE (which really ought to be much smaller).\r\n\r\nIf so, could we drop the END_HEADERS thing entirely and say that HPACK-bearing frames are fully self-contained?  It would simplify a lot of client mechanics."

That's not necessarily practical.\r\n\r\nCould we carve out a segment of the error space and define them to be application-defined, so each application mapping can add whatever error codes are relevant to it?  E.g. QUIC currently defines  QUIC_DECOMPRESSION_FAILURE, but QUIC defines no compression.  That's really there for HPACK, I presume.\r\n\r\nWe could do likewise for handshake errors, since that's also pluggable -- QUIC will have its own AEAD error codes, but things that could go wrong in the handshake will vary by which handshake protocol we're using."

All stream management is delegated to QUIC.\r\n- HTTP exchanges take up two streams per request/response -- one for data, one for everything else (but mostly headers).  This permits retaining the current behavior (also from HTTP/2) of not flow-controlling non-DATA traffic, and avoids double-framing bodies.\r\n- HPACK frames acquire sequence numbers to enable ordering at the decoder.  This is decidedly suboptimal, but no worse than current and allows us to keep moving and leave the potential redesign of HPACK for the future.\r\n\r\nIt may be more useful to look at the [final content](https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/http-unstraddled/draft-ietf-quic-http.html) rather than the diff -- in places, GitHub isn't finding enough of the retained text to make the diff sensible."

    "body": "Quoting Martin Duke:\r\n> RFC-Compliant ICMP PMTU messages include the\r\n> oversize packet's IP header and the first 8 bytes of the transport. This\r\n> allows  TCP to demultiplex the ICMP to the relevant connection/path, and\r\n> check that the echoed sequence number corresponds to an in-flight segment,\r\n> and that the segment that would have violated the advertised MTU. As TCP\r\n> windows increase, it's true that this may be less effective.\r\n>\r\n> For QUIC, these messages will contain only the UDP header. I believe this is\r\n> sufficient to demux to the right connection (QUIC allows the same 4-tuple\r\n> for multiple connection IDs, but it would be fine to apply it to all such\r\n> connections), but I see no clear mechanism to prevent a blind attacker that\r\n> guesses the 4-tuple from forcing a QUIC connection to revert to the min path\r\n> MTU. Some possibilities:\r\n>     (a) Require routers to send more bytes. This is probably not deployable,\r\n> and in any case because packet numbers always start at zero this doesn't add\r\n> much security.\r\n>     (b) Store UDP or IP data. We could require QUIC to store the UDP\r\n> checksum or IP ID in its send queue, thus allowing it to associate the\r\n> returned headers with a packet in its queue. This is ugly from a layering\r\n> perspective and may not be plausible with hardware offload of checksums,\r\n> various middleboxes, etc.\r\n>     (c) Isolated DF packets. QUIC could pick a long time interval (10\r\n> seconds?) in which is sets DF on a single MTU-sized packet (which may have\r\n> to be padded). QUIC would only accept ICMP messages within an RTT or so of\r\n> having sent one of these MTU probe packets, or until it's acked. Thus the\r\n> probabability an off-path attacker could time it correctly is (RTT / 10\r\n> sec). If there's an extended burst of ICMP to overcome this, that's probably\r\n> an attack indication to handle either in IP, the firewall, or at worst in\r\n> QUIC.  I have some language to codify this, and if we agree this is the\r\n> right approach I can share it."

    "body": "The IETF has a common representation for packet headers that most other RFCs follow. [Section 3.1 of RFC2360](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2360#section-3.1) describes the basic idea, but other more recent RFCs have adopted some extensions (e.g., the [HIP protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5201)).\r\n\r\nThe QUIC drafts should use the same representation. The current figures don't always have proportional field lengths, don't show bit flags, etc., which IMO is confusing. If we don't want fo fix the figures, I'd rather replace the current figures with a textual list of fields, rather than using something that looks familiar to IETFers but is really something different.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out http://asciiflow.com/ for making diagrams."

    "body": "It's currently unclear how two QUIC peers opening a connection know which handshake protocol to expect on Stream 1.\r\n\r\nSince the client has to include the opening handshake in its first flight, it has to at least be able to guess *a* handshake protocol that's acceptable to the server and include enough information for the server to know which one it's attempting.  Currently all the mechanisms for telling the client to retry with different options are at the TLS layer, which is too late.\r\n\r\nHow is this negotiated?  Is it baked into the QUIC version?  Is it specified as part of the application mapping (e.g. the HTTP mapping currently requires the TLS 1.3 handshake to be used) and therefore either supplied as part of the Alt-Svc record or implied by the port?"

    "body": "The submission was complicated by the fact that the documents cross-reference each other, which makes for some difficulty during the build/submission process.  Martin worked around that initially by just changing the references to be by title instead of by I-D name.  For the future, however, should we make the documents acyclic?  That would require clarifying the interfaces between the components we intend to make separable, which I think is a strictly good thing.\r\n\r\nMy initial inclination is that the core spec should reference none of the others, and each of the others should reference only the core spec.  The HTTP mapping doesn’t care what loss detection or security handshake is used, only that they provide the features needed by QUIC.  Currently, we explicitly require that the TLS handshake be used, but I’m not convinced that’s necessary.  (Alternately, we could reference the actual TLS RFC and require that “a handshake using TLS” be employed, rather than the particular handshake we’re currently defining.)  The loss detection and security components shouldn’t care about each other either, so long as they can trust that the jobs are getting done.  The core spec should contain the interfaces for all these intersection points.\r\n\r\nGiven that we’ve already agreed that we intend these pieces to be modular, I think this is *probably* an editorial-class change, albeit a big one."

The tricky part is on the server, where it has to work out whether it can use a 1-RTT protected packet, even though it hasn't seen the client's Finished.\r\n\r\nObviously, if there is client authentication, wait.  That's easy.\r\n\r\nI've allowed a server to use these packets if it accepted 0-RTT on the basis that the 1-RTT keys are strictly better than the 0-RTT keys and that it wants to continue processing data.  I've said that it has to assume 0-RTT protection, even though technically these aren't subject to replay.\r\n\r\nI've weaselled out of saying anything about the third case (no 0-RTT).\r\n\r\n@ekr, thoughts?"

This is unlikely, but still something implementations need to handle.  It's not a problem as such unless you insist that connections blow up on decryption failure (which we shouldn't, that's a DoS vector).\r\n\r\nIt's also not a really bad problem because we have packet numbers that should identify the reordered packet as belonging to the older epoch.  We know what the keys were at that time (if we chose to retain them), so it's not even the case that we need to discard the packet every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

QUIC uses a TLS exporter to obtain its initial seed keys.  As long as the exporter secret remains viable (and it will by default in most TLS stacks), then it will be able to compromise any QUIC packet protection keys.\r\n\r\nWe can't close the TLS connection on stream 1 early because it is desirable to have new session tickets issued to clients over time, especially if a server wants to update keys in response to mobility or other significant events.\r\n\r\nWe could recommend that TLS stacks provide an API for destroying an exporter secret, but that would interact poorly with things like token binding which use the exporter secret constantly."
